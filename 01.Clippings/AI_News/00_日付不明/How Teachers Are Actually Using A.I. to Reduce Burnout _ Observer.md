Yaeger creates every lesson according to the Universal Design for Learning principles, which are based on a framework designed to elevate strengths and eliminate barriers for individual learners. “I use A.I. as a think partner to create inclusive lessons that cater to the diverse needs of my students by offering multiple means of representation, engagement and expression,” she said.For example, when teaching students whose native languages are not English, Yaeger uses generative A.I. for translation into “several languages at once,” she said. She also uses the technology to adjust the text not by grade but by WIDA English Language Development (ELD) level, a framework for educating multi-lingual learners.Jeff StoltzfusStoltzfus has used A.I. to create curriculums, which he has limited experience with. “Being more of a visually creative person, writing feels like work to me,” he said. “It takes me longer, and I’m just constantly pointing over my writing, so I don’t love it. [A.I.] was helpful, at least in getting me half of the way there, and then I could customize it.”In Stoltzfus’ field, he grapples with whether there’s still value in teaching students how to use a real camera, like a DSLR with manual settings, when today’s smartphones can achieve similar photography quality. Stoltzfus approaches this problem with the help of A.I. He used Pi, “It helped me create a lesson plan for a scavenger hunt, where students take the same photograph with a DSLR and with their phone, and then compare the results of the two to see the things that they’re able to do well with one and are challenged with the other, or vice versa,” Stoltzfus said.Besides Pi, Stoltzfus also uses Google’s Notebook LM, which can turns documents into interactive podcasts.However, A.I. is not at the place where it can grade students’ work, at least in Stoltzfus’ realm because art is largely subjective. “It’s my failing students that consume most of my extra hours,” he said, referring to how it requires extra work to communicate with and build plans for students who may need extra support. “I wouldn’t want that to be automated. That’s part of being empathetic.”Stoltzfus still has a lot of work, but A.I. seems to take the edge off. For teachers like Yaeger who are able to trim hours off their work week, the difference is more substantial and potentially career-saving.While teachers work in their own ways to improve their quality of teaching and life through tech, third-party companies are working on building out options for teachers, too. The online learning platform “GenAI will make personalized, interactive learning possible at scale, while A.I. tools streamline administrative tasks,” One of the online courses Coursera offers for educators is “Coursera Coach is available in 24 languages and can help students master course concepts more effectively, test their skills and receive feedback in real time (even when the teacher is busy helping another student). Students, too, are using A.I. at a high rate, with Stoltzfus is a creative person and a teacher. For both of these categories, he said, “It’s not the end of the world. It’s the beginning of a new world.”【要約】
教師のバーンアウト（燃え尽き症候群）対策としてAIが活用され始めている。米国では教師の16%が毎年離職し、その半数が教育業界を去る深刻な状況にある。AIの具体的な活用例：
• 多言語への翻訳や英語学習レベルに応じた教材の調整
• カリキュラム作成の補助
• 授業計画の立案支援
• 個別指導のサポートCourseraなどの教育プラットフォームも、AI機能を搭載した教師支援ツールを開発。教師の48%が定期的にAIを使用し、21%が日常的に活用している。AIは教師の管理業務を効率化し、生徒との関わりや創造性を育む時間を確保することに貢献している。ただし、採点や生徒との共感的なコミュニケーションなど、人間の判断が必要な部分はAIに任せられないという認識も示されている。
