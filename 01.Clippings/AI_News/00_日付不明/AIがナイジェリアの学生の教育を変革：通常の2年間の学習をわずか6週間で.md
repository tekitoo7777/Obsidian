Southern Nigeria isn’t exactly where you’d expect a revolution in education to start. But in the bustling schools of Benin City, a new era may be dawning.“AI helps us to learn, it can serve as a tutor, it can be anything you want it to be, depending on the prompt you write,” says Omorogbe Uyiosa, known as “Uyi” by his friends, a student from the Edo Boys High School. Uyi’s school was one of the participants in groundbreaking pilot program that integrates generative AI into The problems Nigerian schools are facing are common in many parts of the world: overcrowded classrooms, too few teachers, scarce resources for The main focus of the program was improving English language skills, but the project also ventured into teaching AI knowledge and digital literacy. The results, soon to be published, exceeded expectations.Students were split into two groups: one that continued as normal, and another one who participated in the This success suggests that students didn’t just absorb material; they learned how to learn. Perhaps even more encouragingly, everyone benefitted from the program, not just the higher-performing students. In fact, girls who were initially performing worse than boys gained more from the intervention.## The more AI lessons, the better

Attendance was a critical factor in the program’s success. Each additional session attended resulted in more improvement. Despite challenges such as flooding, teacher strikes, and after-school work commitments, students who persevered gained disproportionately more benefits from the program.The program also revealed something important: the gains didn’t plateau. This suggests that extending such interventions could lead to even greater outcomes. The “dose-response” relationship underscores the importance of consistent, prolonged engagement for maximizing impact.To put the results in perspective, the program achieved a 0.3 standard deviation improvement in learning outcomes — a gain equivalent to nearly two years of typical schooling in just six weeks. Compared to other The more AI sessions students attended the better they fared in assessments.

The project was spearheaded by Martín E. De Simone, an Education Specialist at the World Bank. In a recent article, De Simone and colleagues explain that the findings are in line with similar projects in other parts of the world:【要約】ナイジェリアの学校でAIを活用した教育プログラムが驚くべき成果を上げました。わずか6週間のプログラムで、通常2年かかる学習効果が得られました。主なポイント：- 英語力、AIスキル、デジタルリテラシーの向上に焦点を当てたプログラムを実施
- 教室の過密化や教師不足などの問題に対し、AIが個別指導の役割を果たした
- 女子生徒を含め、すべての生徒が恩恵を受け、特に成績下位の生徒の伸びが顕著
- 出席回数が多いほど学習効果が高く、効果の上限は見られなかった
- この成果は、開発途上国での教育介入の中で上位20%に入る効果的なものだった
このプログラムの成功は、AIが教育のチート手段としてではなく、特に資源の限られた学校での学習支援ツールとして大きな可能性を持つことを示しています。ただし、長期的な効果や規模の拡大については、さらなる検証が必要とされています。
