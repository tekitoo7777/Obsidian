They noted that AI assessment platforms are able to provide students with feedback in a timelier manner than they are able to, and that student information systems allow teaching staff to better track students’ progress across modules, and provide feedback or highlight where interventions might be needed.Overall, the majority (60 per cent) of lecturers felt the digital teaching environment offered by their institution was good, excellent or the “best imaginable” – a small decline on last year’s results, where 64 per cent of respondents gave these responses.juliette.rowsell@timeshighereducation.comRead more about:Teaching and learningTechnology and new media### Register to continue
