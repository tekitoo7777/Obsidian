The program will help teachers get familiar with AI tools, give them time to explore how they work, and find ways to use them to help students learn better.Educators will have the chance to team up with their peers to share ideas and figure out the best ways to use AI in their classrooms.The initiative also plans to create a statewide resource hub to spark new ideas and shape policies for using AI in schools.Matthew Winters, an AI education specialist for the Utah State Board of Education., said, We know that our students are going to be entering into careers where they’ll work with non-human companions. How do we prepare our students for that?"Winters also pointed to the risks of not preparing teachers and students for AI."That means training, professional development," he said.He added that a key focus will be teaching educators how to use AI safely and effectively in classrooms.The initiative comes as educators’ views on AI are shifting. While a 2023 survey showed that more than 40% of Utah teachers were pessimistic about using AI in the classroom, a more recent survey from 2024 showed that over 90% of teachers are now at least somewhat familiar with the technology.___
