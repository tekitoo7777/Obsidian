A new survey reveals surprising information about who is more comfortable using AI in school. While 34 percent of educators report using AI very frequently to draft or review assignments, only 24 percent of students do the same, highlighting a significant trend in AI adoption and sentiment within the educational landscape.The insight comes from the 2024 AI in Academia Study by “Educators are at the forefront of integrating AI into educational practices, finding it a valuable tool for enhancing learning experiences,” said Alon Yamin, CEO and co-founder of Copyleaks. “However, our findings suggest that there is an opportunity to foster a positive relationship between students and AI. Open dialogues in the classroom between educators and students about ethical use and AI’s potential role in enhancing learning can empower students to harness its benefits effectively and responsibly.”Key findings from the study include:Frequent AI usage- Thirty-four percent of educators use AI very frequently to draft or review assignments, showing high adoption among educators. Only 24 percent of students use AI this often, with 22 percent of students using it very rarely compared to just 12 percent of educators.
- Of note, 29 percent of male students use AI often, compared to 16 percent of females.
Enthusiasm for AI integration- Seventy percent of educators are keen on more AI integration in the classroom, indicating strong support for tech-enhanced teaching. Meanwhile, 58 percent of students share this enthusiasm, reflecting a more modest interest in AI for their studies.
Optimism for personalized learning- A strong majority–87 percent of educators and 78 percent of students–believe AI can revolutionize education through personalized learning experiences.
Comfort and trust in AI tools- Thirty-one percent of educators express high comfort with AI-powered educational apps, slightly surpassing the 27 percent of students.
- Trust in AI for study recommendations is nearly identical, with 28 percent of educators and 29 percent of students expressing strong confidence in these tools.
Significant unsanctioned AI usage- Educators and students differ greatly in following school AI ethics policies. Only 27 percent of educators claim to have misused AI tools, compared to 55 percent of students.
- Of note, high school students have the highest rate of using AI tools in a sanctioned manner (63 percent), with males outpacing females 64 percent vs 51 percent.
Differing sentiments on understanding AI- A strong 68% of educators view understanding how AI works as very important, whereas only 41 percent of students share this perspective, highlighting a notable difference in sentiment toward AI literacy.
Awareness and recognition of AI detection- Both groups are highly aware of AI detection software, with 87% of students and educators acknowledging these tools for managing cheating and plagiarism.
- Undergraduate educators had the highest rate of awareness (96 percent), while middle school educators had the lowest rate (75 percent).
“Today’s educators are excited about AI’s potential to personalize learning and manage workloads, with a strong desire to integrate it more deeply into classrooms,” Yamin added. “However, this shift comes with challenges. The gap between awareness and ethical use, especially among students, highlights the need for clear guidelines and training to ensure AI enhances education responsibly. These findings emphasize the need for targeted educational initiatives that empower educators and students to use AI effectively. Addressing concerns from both sides while promoting fair use will be crucial to improving the educational experience for everyone.”This press release この記事は、教育におけるAI使用に関する包括的な調査結果を要約しています。主な内容は以下の通りです：- 教育者の方が学生よりもAIの使用頻度が高く、34%の教育者が非常に頻繁にAIを使用しているのに対し、学生は24%にとどまっています。
