an illustration of raised hands with school papers in the backgroundGiven education’s critical role in human development, it’s imperative that any use of generative AI to boost the teaching and learning process for students be done in a way that is thoughtful and collaborative.That’s why Listening to our communities to better understand their needs allows us to create more helpful products that truly benefit students and educators. To help do that, we partnered with Google’s Responsible AI (RAI) and Technology & Society research teams to engage with high school students and their parents to learn how generative AI is shaping their learning experience.Here are some things parents and students told us about how generative AI supports their learning:1. Real-time feedback for parents
1. Enhanced learning about unfamiliar subjects
1. Customized pathways for people with learning differences
## Teachers will always be the heart of the classroom
While generative AI is poised to play a pivotal role in education, human educators remain irreplaceable. Generative AI can enhance learning, without undermining it, which is why guardrails and transparency are key to making generative AI the powerful tool that it promises to be for education.Keeping the “teacher in the loop” is core to how Google for Education builds and designs its products, informing the features we choose and the safeguards we put in place. We will always prioritize With generative AI at their side, teachers will be able to better serve students with a wide range of diverse needs and preferences, saving them time on administrative tasks and ultimately helping them focus on what they do best: inspiring and challenging students, using their experience and soft skills like listening and empathy to create a haven where minds are opened and curiosity can thrive. When the best teachers are paired with the best tools, their students become unstoppable.As one student in our research said, “Teachers always make sure I am okay, that I have the best mindset for the class. I think I couldn’t do it without them. I’d probably be in a whole different place right now.”

Googleの研究チームは、高校生とその保護者、教師と連携し、生成型AIが学習体験にどのように影響を与えているかを調査しました。以下は、保護者と生徒が語った3つの主要なポイントです：1. リアルタイムのフィードバック
1. 未知の科目についての学習強化
1. 学習の違いに応じたカスタマイズ
また、教師は依然として教育の中心であり、生成型AIはその役割を補完するものであると強調されています。Googleは、教師と学校との緊密なフィードバックループを維持し続け、生成型AIを活用した教育ツールを開発しています。
