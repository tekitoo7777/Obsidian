| The Entrepreneur TimesIN THE ever-evolving landscape of education, artificial intelligence has emerged as a beacon of transformation. The integration of AI into the academic curricula of institutions in Bangladesh holds tremendous potential to realise the vision of Digital Bangladesh. By revolutionising how education is delivered and experienced, AI can drive significant advancements in the country’s educational framework.Harnessing the power of AI allows educational institutions in Bangladesh to enhance learning outcomes, personalise educational experiences, and better prepare students for the demands of a competitive workplace. This column delves into the strategic uses of AI in education, exploring methodologies for its integration and the profound impact it can have on teaching and learning, particularly within the context of Bangladesh.By adopting AI technologies, policymakers can ensure that Bangladesh not only keeps pace with global educational standards but also becomes a leader in educational innovation. This strategic move aligns seamlessly with the national agenda, fostering an environment where students are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to thrive in the 21st century. Through thoughtful implementation and support, AI can be the catalyst that propels Bangladesh towards a brighter, more technologically advanced future. Here are the key aspects and strategies for implementation:AI-enhanced personalised learningUse: AI algorithms can analyse students’ learning patterns and tailor content to suit their pace and understanding, thus creating a personalised learning environment.Strategy: Implement AI-driven platforms that adjust the complexity and depth of learning materials based on real-time student performance data. For Bangladesh, integrating such systems can help bridge the educational gaps by providing tailored content to diverse student populations. Schools can adopt platforms like DreamBox for mathematics or Knewton for various subjects, which use AI to create personalised learning paths.Outcome: Improved student engagement and retention rates will become a possibility, as content is aligned with individual learning curves. In Bangladesh, this could translate into higher overall academic performance, reducing dropout rates, and ensuring that students from different backgrounds receive the support they need to succeed.Predictive analyticsUse: Utilising AI to predict student performance and potential learning roadblocks before they become problematic.Strategy: Integrate AI tools that use historical data to identify at-risk students, allowing for timely intervention. Implementing predictive analytics in Bangladeshi schools can help educators identify and support students who are struggling, ensuring that resources are allocated efficiently.Outcome: Higher success rates can be achieved through proactive support and remediation, reducing dropout rates, and enhancing academic achievement. This approach can be particularly effective in rural and underserved areas of Bangladesh, where educational resources are often limited.Facilitating inclusive educationUse: AI-driven programmes can provide real-time translation and accessibility features, such as speech-to-text for hearing-impaired students or text-to-speech for visually impaired students.Strategy: Deploy AI tools across digital platforms used by the institution to ensure all learning materials are accessible to every student. In Bangladesh, this could include tools that translate content into local languages and dialects, making education more inclusive.Outcome: An inclusive learning environment will be ensured where all students, regardless of disability or language barriers, can participate fully and equally.AI tutors and assistantsUse: AI systems designed to act as personal tutors provide additional support by clarifying doubts, offering explanations, and helping with homework.Strategy: Introduce AI tutors in subjects with high dropout rates or where students traditionally struggle. For Bangladesh, AI tutors could be particularly beneficial in subjects like mathematics and science, where students often face challenges.Outcome: Enhanced understanding of complex subjects, better academic performance will be achieved, and dropout rates will be reduced.Simulation and gamificationUse: Using AI to create realistic simulations and gamified learning experiences that engage students in experiential learning.Strategy: Develop discipline-specific simulations that allow students to practice and hone skills in a virtual environment. In Bangladesh, this could involve creating simulations that teach practical skills in areas such as agriculture, healthcare, and engineering.Outcome: Students gain practical experience and a deeper understanding of theoretical concepts, making them better prepared for real-world applications.Automated grading systemsUse: AI tools that can quickly and accurately grade a wide range of assignments, from written essays to complex mathematical problems.Strategy: Implement these systems to provide immediate feedback, allowing students to learn and adapt quickly. In Bangladesh, this could help manage large class sizes and provide timely feedback to students.Outcome: More efficient assessment processes and timely feedback lead to improved learning outcomes and student satisfaction.Dynamic feedback toolsUse: AI-driven feedback tools that provide students with insights into their learning styles, strengths, and areas for improvement.Strategy: Pair these tools with regular coursework to offer continuous, personalised feedback. For Bangladeshi students, this could foster a more self-directed learning approach, helping them understand their own learning processes better.Outcome: Students become more self-aware and can take charge of their own learning, leading to greater academic success.Preparing for dynamic workplaceINTEGRATING AI into education not only enhances teaching and learning but also equips students with the skills necessary to thrive in a dynamic and competitive workplace. Students who are accustomed to AI-enhanced learning environments are likely to adapt more seamlessly to the technological demands of modern careers. Institutions that embrace these technologies can provide a cutting-edge education that prepares students not just to meet the future but to shape it.By strategically incorporating AI across different facets of the educational spectrum, institutions in Bangladesh can foster an environment that not only achieves outstanding learning outcomes but also prepares students effectively for the challenges and opportunities of the future workplace. This holistic approach ensures that learners are not only well-versed in academic knowledge but also proficient in leveraging technology, thus positioning them as leaders in the global economy. As Bangladesh continues to develop its educational infrastructure, the integration of AI can play a crucial role in elevating the quality and accessibility of education, ultimately contributing to the nation’s progress and prosperity.Dr Serajul I Bhuiyan is a tenured professor and former chair of the department of journalism and mass communications at Savannah State University, Savannah, Georgia, USA, and former president of the Business and Applied Sciences Academy of North America.教育の進化する風景において、AIは変革の灯台となっています。バングラデシュの学術カリキュラムにAIを統合することは、「デジタルバングラデシュ」のビジョンを実現するための非常に大きな可能性を秘めています。AIは、学習結果の向上、教育体験の個別化、そして競争力のある職場の要求に学生をよりよく準備することを可能にします。AI技術を採用することで、政策立案者はバングラデシュが世界の教育基準を保つだけでなく、教育イノベーションのリーダーにもなることを保証できます。AIは、21世紀に活躍するために必要なスキルと知識を持った学生を育てる環境を促進し、バングラデシュをより明るく、技術的に進歩した未来へと推進する触媒となり得ます。教育にAIを統合することは、教育と学習を強化するだけでなく、動的で競争力のある職場で活躍するために必要なスキルを学生に提供します。AIが強化された学習環境に慣れている学生は、現代のキャリアの技術的要求によりスムーズに適応する可能性があります。
