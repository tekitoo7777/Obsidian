AI generated school tests: White AI robot's hand reaching out to meet index finger-tip to index finger-tip with hand of man's arms in burgundy shirtThis This summer, everyone from By harnessing AI to create frequent, low-stakes assessments, teachers can unlock the scientifically proven benefits of the Unlocking the promise of AI requires first understanding the Unfortunately, in most classrooms, opportunities for students to practice retrieving, connecting and organizing knowledge through testing happen rarely — think occasional quizzes or infrequent unit tests. This isn’t surprising, given all the pressures teachers face. Developing and grading tests is time-intensive — not to mention thankless — work.But AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude 3.5 Sonnet can change that. They can generate diverse, personalized assessments quickly, potentially helping teachers leverage the testing effect more effectively — converting a counterintuitive research finding into a classroom practice that could save time and help students learn more. With AI handling the creation and analysis of tests, educators can easily incorporate frequent, low-stakes assessments into their lesson plans.## How does it work?
To illustrate, we asked ChatGPT to create a 10-minute test on natural resources for sixth graders in Maryland. In less than 10 seconds, the tool provided options for multiple choice, true/false, short answer, matching and diagram interpretation questions. We even got a creative thinking essay prompt: “If you were a superhero tasked with protecting Earth’s natural resources, what would be your superpower and why?” By picking and choosing test items, running the prompt a second time and lightly editing a couple of questions, we had a compelling quiz, created in 10 minutes. The AI tool also provided comprehensive instructions and an answer key.Teachers can tailor this process in dozens of ways. They can input key concepts and learning objectives to fit their curriculum needs. They can fine-tune test questions for relevance and difficulty. They can inform ChatGPT about the class’s interests to bolster student engagement.What about grading? Not only can AI Take, for example, a language class with a ChatGPT-generated vocabulary test. For objective parts of exams, like multiple-choice questions, students might self-assess by using ChatGPT to grade these items quickly. For tasks like sentence construction, students might engage in peer assessment to gain new insights from classmates on word choices and sentence structure. Teachers can step in for more complex tasks such as creative writing. Rotating among AI, peers and teachers lightens the grading load significantly while ensuring diverse, rich feedback.Embracing AI-assisted strategic testing could create a more effective and fulfilling educational experience for students and teachers alike. As educators navigate the evolving landscape of AI in education, strategic testing offers a balanced approach. It leverages AI’s capabilities to enhance teaching and learning while preserving the crucial role of human teachers in the classroom. This summer, as educators reflect and plan for the future, they should reconsider testing not as a mere assessment tool, but as a powerful catalyst for learning.- **
