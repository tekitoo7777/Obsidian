When you hear “AI” and “schools” in the same sentence, you might think ‘Wait a minute, isn’t that“AI and adaptive software have completely changed how our classrooms look, our school climate, and culture. The student engagement is absolutely magnificent,”Since taking the helm in 2021, Arrott’s one of a few thousand school leaders nationwide to go all-in on ““It has really changed everything, and it’s really magical when you experience our campus now compared to three years ago,” Arrott explains.“This (My Math Academy) provides us a way to reach every single one of our kiddos where they are and how they learn best,” Pease Kindergarten teacher## Can AI help students recover from pandemic learning loss?
Three years ago, students were just returning to classrooms in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Arrott was still relatively new to the principal role at the pre-K through 2nd grade school, with a student body of around 550 kids. And she faced even more challenges.Odessa is on the westernmost borders of America’s heartland, the location of one of the mostIt’s also a region that knows the high highs of oil booms and winning streaks, and the low lows of busts and losses. The year 2021 was a low.Between a series ofTheAt a time when everyone was struggling – not just at Pease, but in similar public schools and communities throughout the country – educators needed a Hail Mary. And new AI tech tools delivered.## What are the benefits of AI in classrooms?
“There are no classrooms where all of the students learn the exact same way and are at the same level,”Hughes says there are several reasons for this, and she’s been working to solve it since first starting with the company’s flagship“What we know fromThis, Hughes says, is where AI can change their futures.“We introduce a new concept, give them some experience with it, and then we have games that are designed to assess what they understand,” Hughes explains. “So, they're playing a game, we're getting a lot of data about whether they've understood (what they’ve been taught) or not. And if we get a sense that they don't understand, for example, by getting wrong answers, then we can apply extra feedback.”What sets this approach apart from “standard” classroom learning is that it only moves on to the next topic or idea when the student is ready. “The system is sort of going through this loop of teaching, assessing, assisting if needed, and then making a choice about what (the student) is ready for,'' Hughes says. "It’s completely different from the ‘one-size-fits-all approach of traditional models. This way, no one else gets left behind, and advanced students don’t get held back either.”The results speak for themselves. Age of Learning has a track record of success in some of the country's most at-risk and low-performing schools, including Jefferson County in Tallahassee, Florida. After## Will AI replace teachers?
At a very different sort of school, Austin’s $40,000 per year private“AI is a great equalizer,” MacKenzie Price, co-founder ofIn “Alpha School,” students spend two hours in the morning focused on personalized education supercharged by AI, with instructors taking the role of “supportive guide and counselor” rather than “traditional teacher,” Price says. Students spend the remaining hours of the school day on life skills, arts, sports, and even entrepreneurship.“It has made learning a lot more fun,” says 18-year-old Peyton Price, a senior at Alpha High (and MacKenzie Price’s daughter). One example Peyton shared is recently using AI to replace lyrics to the Taylor Swift song “Blank Slate” to help her study for her AP U.S. Government final.“Nice to meet you, let's begin, explaining AP Gov, where to begin? Declaration of Independence, set the stage, for American democracy, a turning page She also uses another of her mother’s latest tech tools, a new ““A lot of adults and educators are like, ‘TikTok is bad, or social media is hurting you,’” Peyton explains, “but what’s working for my generation is people who ask us, ‘What are the things you find interesting, what do you enjoy,’ and then figure out how to make a version of that to help with our education.”Google enhances search:MacKenzie Price adds, “That’s what we’re doing here, taking all those potential negative effects of screen time and turning that into learning. We’re taking the power of AI and using it for good.”## Can AI help all the kids at public schools?
Back in Odessa, 8-year-old second grader Trip Galloway tells a similar story. Trip is an advanced student at Pease Elementary. “He’s in the second grade but already reading at ninth grade level,” his mother Savannah said over the phone. “He learns so quickly that he was getting bored and just kind of tuning out in school. Once they started AI learning, he’s able to excel, concentrate, and work more to his ability.”“It’s important because it teaches us things the teacher wouldn’t normally (be able to) because the apps teach you when you need it,” Trip chimes in. “Most of my friends are a grade level under me, and it didn’t used to be any fun. Now it’s fun.”When I ask Trip what it would be like to return to how things used to be in his classroom, he groans and says, “It would feel boring because, with the (AI), we’re doing our things faster and more fun. It’s way better than doing worksheets all day and having the teachers teach us all day.”That’s a tough sentiment for veteran teachers like Carlton Conn-Oquendo to hear. She’s taught various grades and subjects at Chicago’s Hawthorne Scholastic Academy for some 42 years and knows firsthand that for all the help AI tools can give students and teachers, they won’t ever replace the single most crucial part of her job.“Technology is a great tool, but it can’t replace the human connection,” she says over the phone. “Most of us still remember that one teacher who really spoke to us and influenced us. You can augment all you want with technology. But it really, really makes an impact on children to have that connection.”Jennifer Jolly is an Emmy Award-winning consumer tech columnist and on-air correspondent.
