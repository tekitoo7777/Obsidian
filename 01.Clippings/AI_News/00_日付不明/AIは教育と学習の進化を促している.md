More than half of teachers and district administrators who are already actively using AI are leveraging it to improve learning experiences and outcomes for students, according to Cambium Learning’s The state of K-12 education has reached an inflection point, and AI has emerged as a versatile tool brimming with potential to support the evolving needs of teachers, students, and schools. The survey aims to better understand how AI is being used by educators today, its impact and opportunity, and what this means for the future of education.Key findings from the 2024 K-12 Educator + AI Survey, which was conducted by Hanover Research, include:Teachers are using AI to personalize and improve student learning, not just run classrooms more efficiently, but challenges remainTeachers report using AI to help run their classrooms more efficiently, with just under half of surveyed respondents using AI for proofreading writing (47 percent) or lesson planning (44 percent). Additionally, teachers and administrators see AI as a path to more personalized student experiences and improved learning. More than half report they are leveraging AI to create personalized learning experiences for students (56 percent), provide real-time performance tracking and feedback (52 percent), and to help students with critical thinking skills (50 percent). Outside of the classroom, administrators report using AI to improve administrative efficiency, including to interpret/analyze student data (61 percent), manage student records (56 percent), and manage professional development (56 percent).The use of AI within the education sector isn’t without its challenges. When ranking the top three barriers to AI adoption in education settings, surveyed teachers and administrators identified the following: data privacy and security, insufficient training for teachers on how to use AI, and uncertainty about the efficacy of AI in improving student outcomes. Additional barriers identified include concerns about the ethical use of generative AI, limited access to reliable internet for all students, and lack of technical support for AI implementation and maintenance. While 80 percent of administrators believe that a candidate’s technical skills are highly important in the hiring process, this has presented challenges as well. In the face of staffing shortages, administrators most frequently cite lack of technology skills among teachers as a difficulty in hiring (38 percent).While post-pandemic challenges persist, the increased use of technology is viewed positively by most teachers and administratorsWhile technology adoption accelerated during the pandemic, student learning loss resulting from the pandemic, staffing shortages, and insufficient mental health and well-being support for students and staff are making it even more challenging for teachers to feel successful. Cambium’s survey reinforced the inherent difficulty of being a teacher right now–with 37 percent agreeing their job is harder than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic.Yet, despite the challenges, there is optimism as well. Perhaps surprisingly, the majority of teachers surveyed (87 percent) plan to stay in their profession. Further, the 37 percent of teachers who believe their job is easier post-pandemic ranked increased use of technology to streamline tasks (43 percent) and increased use of technology to personalize student learning (40 percent) as top contributors, and technology usage in classrooms is viewed positively by 81 percent of teachers. The increased use of technology in the classroom is also seen by administrators (72 percent) as a key way to attract more teachers to the profession.As the use of AI and advanced technology grows, the education professions continues to evolveThis surge of innovation has given rise to new demands, skills, and potential risks. In response, schools are introducing new requirements and opportunities to help prepare, support, secure, and equip education professionals with the tools they need. More than half of surveyed administrators and teachers confirmed they are now required to complete edtech and cybersecurity training as part of their professional development. Additionally, 20 percent of surveyed respondents said their schools/districts have created new job positions such as Educational Technology Specialist, Technology Teacher, AI Education Researcher, Education Data Analyst, AI Development Expert, AI Strategic Scientist, and Edtech Consultant.“We are at a pivotal moment in education. AI has moved beyond a theoretical opportunity or challenge; it’s no longer a question of ‘will we or won’t we.’ AI is not only here, but it is already being used in U.S. K-12 schools and around the world,” said Ashley Andersen Zantop, Chairman and CEO of Cambium Learning Group. “Despite the varying challenges teachers, students, and school faculty currently face, the K-12 community continues to innovate and embrace new technology. As an edtech organization, we have a critical duty to operate as a worthy steward of our community’s trust. We strive to remove barriers to opportunity by supporting our students, educators and families with solutions and thought leadership rooted in safe, responsible and effective use of AI and other emerging technologies that empower the people we serve.”This press release originally appeared online.

AIとテクノロジーツールが教育の革新をもたらし、学校および地区の効率を向上させています。Cambium Learningの調査によると、多くの教師と管理者はAIを用いて学習体験を個別化し、学生の成績を向上させています。しかし、データプライバシーやセキュリティ、教師のAIトレーニング不足などの課題も存在します。パンデミック後の技術採用は加速しましたが、依然として人材不足やメンタルヘルスの支援の不足が課題です。それでも、多くの教育者は前向きで、AIと先進技術の使用が増えることで教育職も進化し、新しいスキルや職務が求められるようになっています。
