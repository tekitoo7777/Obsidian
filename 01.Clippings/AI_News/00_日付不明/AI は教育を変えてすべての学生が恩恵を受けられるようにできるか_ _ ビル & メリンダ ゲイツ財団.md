Students walk inside the Kibera Primary School compound in Kibera, Kenya.Senior Program Officer, Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationSep 11, 20248 min readI remember the day I first experienced I looked at my students, eyes glued to their computer screens, ears covered by headphones, all working in silence using an adaptive maths program. While marvelling at the rare moment of tranquillity, I also wondered: If the students were learning from the technology, what was the point of me being there? After all, I was a teacher, and a rather good one (if I do say so myself!).Using the student learning outcomes data generated by the educational technology (edtech) program, I split the class into two groups based on their competencies: I taught half of them, while the others worked quietly on their computers, and then we switched. I kept using the data generated by the program to inform my teaching, and over time the students’ results improved. Technology in service of the teacher and the students contributed to our maths results being a top 2% value-add in England!![image_20250519_192009.png](../assets/image_20250519_192009.png)
Dr. Asyia Kazmi speaks at the Global Education Convening in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Fast-forward to today: Generative AI technology is mind-blowing, with great potential to be harnessed for teaching and learning. In a world where I have experienced many edtech pitches over the years, but only a few have impressed me. Most are either too focused on the technology or on reaching large numbers of students, without considering the pedagogy, or they fail to address the challenges and barriers that underserved students face in accessing and using technology, particularly in low- and middle-income contexts.Furthermore, it is all too rare to see any evidence of impact on learning outcomes. (If you don’t show impact, I will assume there is none!)A few edtech solutions combine evidence and the best of human expertise and wisdom with the benefits that technology can afford, particularly in data analysis. And with the recent advances in AI, especially in natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision, I have seen pitches that have blown me away—they genuinely make me wish I were teaching again.Here are three problems that students and teachers across the globe face, along with AI-based solutions that could help, if they are implemented with careful thought, informed by data, For a glossary of technical terms. ## Problem 1: Many students don’t have access to high-quality learning resources that are tailored to their needs, interests, and learning levels.
Students may struggle to learn from their starting point and at their own pace, receive timely and constructive feedback, or struggle to find motivation and support for their learning goals. If they fall behind, they are likely to stay behind and drop out, failing to acquire important life skills.AI-based solutions:- Personalized adaptive learning solutions
- AI tutors
Implementation:These tools need to be able to assess students’ current learning levels and chart the most effective and efficient learning trajectory; ensure that the content aligns with the national curriculum and is relevant and engaging; and, importantly, be sensitive to bias. The issue of how children’s data is gathered and used, and what can be diagnosed from it, requires serious consideration and established guidelines.## Watch: Bill Gates and Tonee Ndungu discuss AI education in Africa

## Problem 2: Some teachers may not have the training, knowledge, and experience they need to be effective in their roles.
Up to 40% of teachers in sub-Saharan AfricaAI-based solutions:- AI-enabled teacher coaches
- AI lesson-planning support programs
- AI assistants
Implementation:Teachers will only use AI-based tools that help solve problems and make their lives easier, so the tools must be user friendly, relevant, and lead to impact. As with student-facing tools, teacher-facing tools must be accurate, engaging, and unbiased, and they must take into account the evidence on how adults, and teachers in particular, learn and apply that learning in the classroom.Nurse Beth Marete conducts an ultrasound scan with handheld ultrasound device on patient, Chiza Wabungo, at the Shangia Dispensary in Mariakani, Kenya on May 16, 2023.![image_20250519_192011.png](../assets/image_20250519_192011.png)
AI that centers equity and accelerates progressLearn more## Problem 3: It is expensive and time consuming to develop high-quality educational content, as well as assessment and evaluation tools, in multiple local languages and contexts.
It is often expensive for governments to produce teaching and learning resources such as student textbooks and lesson plans in multiple local languages. Governments and educational systems may also lack the data and insights to make informed decisions and policies for improving educational outcomes and equity. Technology can generate good first drafts for experts to review.AI-based solutions:- AI translators
- AI assessors
- AI evaluators
Implementation:These emerging tools need careful research, development, and testing. They need to have established benchmarks and include quality assurance mechanisms to ensure that translations are accurate and pedagogical principles are followed. Assessments must be accurate and available and cover enough languages, subjects, and age groups. AI-enabled evaluations in the Global South are at a nascent stage, so new tools need to be tested against human evaluators for accuracy and efficiency.## Principles for guiding AI in global education—and beyond
The opportunity to improve educational outcomes through AI is substantial. But we must all keep asking who is and isn’t benefiting from these technological advances. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has established an 1. Equity
1. Data privacy
1. Ethics
1. Evidence and accuracy
1. Impact
Engaging with AI or not is no longer a choice. AI is being used already. The world ignores it at the risk of deepening educational inequities in ways we do not yet understand. So let’s put systems and processes in place to ensure that students from all walks of life can benefit from these innovations.Let’s also work with teachers to enable their use of this technology so they can get the greatest impact for themselves and their students. We have an opportunity to revisit, on a broad scale, what I did in the ’90s, by asking, “How can I use this technology to serve my students and myself most effectively?” I believe it is the integration of technology into teachers’ work that will have the greatest impact.The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is proud to directly fund the following partners mentioned in this article: Computer visionDialogue systemGenerative AIMachine learningMachine translationNatural language processingOptical character recognitionSemantic analysisSpeech recognitionAuthorAsyia KazmiSenior Program Officer, Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationAsyia Kazmi supports the foundation's effort to improve foundational literacy and numeracy learning outcomes in the global south.

- AIを活用した教育ツールには、適応型学習プラットフォーム、AIチューター、教師向けのAIコーチ、レッスンプランニング支援、管理業務の自動化などがある。
- これらのツールは、学習成果の向上、教師の負担軽減、教育へのアクセス拡大などの利点がある。
- AIの教育への導入には、公平性、データプライバシー、倫理、証拠に基づく精度、影響力の測定という5つの原則が重要。
- AIの適切な導入により、教育の不平等を減らし、すべての学生に恩恵をもたらす可能性がある。
結論として、AIは教育を変革する大きな可能性を持っていますが、その実装には慎重な検討と倫理的なアプローチが必要です。🌟 教育の未来がAIで変わる！ビル＆メリンダ・ゲイツ財団が示す、AIが教育にもたらす革命的な可能性とは？📚 個別化学習、教師支援、多言語コンテンツ開発...AIが解決する3つの教育課題🤖 適応型学習、AIチューター、自動化ツールで、すべての生徒に平等な学びのチャンスを！🔍 AIの教育活用に必要な5つの重要原則も解説未来の教室、どうなる？👀 #AI教育 #EdTech #教育革命詳細は記事をチェック👇
