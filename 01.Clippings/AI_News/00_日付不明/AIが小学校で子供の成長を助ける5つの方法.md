Conceptual depiction of elementary school age enrichment with AI.gettyWith autumn in full swing — and our kids getting back into the rhythm of school — most parents and guardians are getting a sense of how their kiddos are doing on homework, quizzes and projects.And since it’s virtually impossible for elementary-age students to love absolutely everything they study in class, it’s reasonable to assume there may be gaps in their learning.Here are five AI-based tools to help fill some of those knowledge gaps and enrich the learning experience for your elementary-age child.## Have Your Child Write Themselves Into A Story
Use a free version of either Claude or ChatGPT and have your child collaborate with you to think up a prompt to introduce themselves into their favorite book series, gaming platform, bedtime story or fairy tale. The prompt could be something like this:Can you create a Minecraft-themed bedtime story for my 10-year old son TJ and work him into the story as a co-main character with the main hero Steve? Please set it up so they can have a different adventure every night as they explore different biomes and interact with different characters. Please have some of the mobs they meet be friendly and join their group. Let's say they have an ultimate quest to go to the End and vanquish the Ender Dragon at some point in the future. Please make each story 5 minutes long.Make sure your child includes specific language from the story they want to enter, to better inform the AI’s draft. For example, the above prompt used Minecraft-laden language such as biomes, mobs, the End and Steve — which actually generated a neat little story for my son!After several days you can ask your child to create an outline of their own as to how they want the story to progress, and then they can enter that into the LLM system for the details to get fleshed out.For some extra fun, copy-and-paste the story for each day into DALL-E, along with the prompt asking it to create five pictures to illustrate the story in an appropriate style that your child likes (e.g. Pixar, Simpsons, SpongeBob...etc.)The AI image generator will produce two different versions of each of the five slides to choose from to place into the story for that night’s reading. One note of caution, be sure to use the images and written story for your own personal reading time with your child and not for commercial sale to avoid ## AI Tutoring For Kids’ Least and Most Favorite Subject
Research and frequent studiesOne cool AI option to consider for both types of kids is With seed funding from Elon Musk and assistance from DARPA researchers, the AI-powered platform evaluates your child’s ability and then adapts the learning experience as they progress using fun, interactive gamification of math concepts. Once its set up it doesn’t require any adult supervision or assistance. It has a free trial and then costs about $1 a day.## The Art of Drawing At Your Child’s Fingertips
Fine motor skills are important and necessary for students in primary school to develop. One way to hone those abilities is through drawing and art classes. Unfortunately, budgetary constraints have forced many districts across the country to A nifty little offering that might serve as a quick little AI art class substitute for kids is called The child is given a prompt to draw something, like a “paper clip” and has 20 seconds to do it using the mouse with a laptop. The AI gives audio guesses. When the AI gets it right, they move on to the next drawing, which could be “green bean.”The doodling cycles through six times and tells how your student and AI team did. What’s kind of neat is that your child is actually training the Google AI how to recognize freehand drawings, while practicing their own speed sketching abilities.## Kid Friendly Computer Coding Skills
There are dozens — if not hundreds — of apps and ways to introduce school-age kids to computer coding; however, very few are as engaging and fun as Each block map gets more difficult with obstacles and steps to navigate, challenging your student to methodically complete a system, which are the basic skills necessary for coding. The app boasts that more than 20 million kids and tens of thousands of teachers have used it. The app has a one-time fee of $2.99.## Students Can Experience History In A Whole New Way
Depending on where you live, elementary history curriculum can touch on ancient, world and US histories. Given that breadth, a useful resource to bring the past into the present for students is This app brings historical figures to life using ChatGPT 4’s AI technology, enabling your child to engage text-based interactions with hundreds of historical figures. The famous person replies via text and audio.The personalities represented range from Cleopatra, Jesus, Napoleon Bonaparte, George Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., Confucius and Jimi Hendrix. The app comes with 10 free messages and then paid plans kick in after that.Most would agree that it’s important for families to support the academic endeavors of their children at all ages and stages of the educational journey. By extending curiosity and inquiry beyond the confines of the classroom, these AI resources can help elevate and demonstrate the critical importance of being a lifelong learner to the next generation.## 記事要約：AIが小学校で子供の成長を助ける5つの方法
