The majority of teachers (64%) are not using ChatGPT professionally, including 19% who are ‘not interested’ in using AI anytime in the future, according to a new study.41% said their school did not have an agreed approach to AI, and a further 17% didn’t know if any policy had existed, according to research by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT.The survey of over 5000 teachers found the vast majority (84%) have not changed the way they assess students’ work, despite the availability of AI tools. Only 41% say they are regularly checking homework and coursework for plagiarism content from the web.The poll by BCS, which is the professional body for computing, covered 2000 secondary schools in England. It suggests new inequalities in the use and understanding of AI in education:Although a small proportion of teachers surveyed were from private schools, the trend was that they were using AI more regularly than their state counterparts.Teachers in the Northwest, Yorkshire and Northeast were slightly less regular users of AI than those in other regions.Only a third (36%) of teachers using AI for lesson preparation had ‘admitted it’ to their senior leadership team or head, suggesting it is seen as ‘cheating’ for teachers as well as students.In its report BCS recommends that understanding of AI is made a significant part of teacher training and heads’ leadership qualifications alongside wider digital literacy. The study also calls for schools to publish AI policies on their websites. But they can only be expected to do that with clear guidance from the Department for Education (DfE), the qualifications regulator (Ofqual), and other relevant bodies, BCS said in a third recommendation. BCS had earlier called for a new digital literacy qualification in schools (which focusses on general skills including using AI tools) alongside the current Computer Science GCSE.The full BCS report For more information, further case studies and interview requests please contact BCS Media Relations and Public Affairs officer Andy Twelves: 07442 654679 or About BCS, The Chartered Institute for ITBCSAbout the report ‘Secondary School Teachers and AI’:BCS, The Chartered Institute for ITThe BCS research was supported by an unrestricted gift received from ## 要約
BCS（英国情報技術専門機関）が実施した新しい調査によると、教師のAI利用に関して以下の主要な発見がありました：- 教師の64%が業務でChatGPTを使用していません（その内19%は将来的な使用にも関心なし）
- 41%の学校がAIに関する合意された方針を持っておらず、17%は方針の有無を把握していません
- 84%の教師がAIツールの利用可能性にもかかわらず、学生の評価方法を変更していません
- 私立学校の教師は公立学校と比較してAIをより定期的に使用する傾向があります
- AIを授業準備に使用している教師の3分割の1のみが、管理職にその使用を報告しています
BCSは以下を推奨しています：- 教師研修と管理職の資格にAIの理解を含めること
- 学校のウェブサイトでAIポリシーを公開すること
- 教育省や資格規制機関からの明確なガイダンスの提供
この調査は5,298人の教師から回答を得て、イギリスの2,600校を対象に実施されました。
