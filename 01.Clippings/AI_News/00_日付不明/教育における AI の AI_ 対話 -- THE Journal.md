I sat down with ChatGPT (OpenAI), CoPilot (Microsoft), and Gemini (Google) for a frank conversation. Some answers were edited since AI, especially ChatGPT, tends toward verbosity.Me: Generative artificial intelligence, just who do you think you are?AI:- I'm a tool that can be incredibly useful, but it's important to understand the technology behind me (Gemini).
- I'm here to assist with information, conversation, and sometimes even a bit of fun or creativity (ChatGPT).
- I apologize if my previous responses caused any discomfort. I’m here to assist … (CoPilot, 
Me: Specifically, when it comes to K-12 education what challenge or problem are you able to help classroom teachers solve?AI:- … saving time in preparation, offering innovative teaching ideas, and enhancing the learning experience for students (
Me: What research underpins your recommendations to K-12 teachers about lesson design?AI:- I can't claim to have conducted my own research on lesson design. However, my recommendations are based on established research in the field of educational psychology and instructional design. (Gemini)

- Research provides valuable insights into effective lesson design for K-12 teachers. Here are a few notable studies: 3D printing, and universal design for learning — UDL. 
Me: Are you likely to help children cheat in K-12 classrooms?AI:- I shouldn't be used in a way that promotes cheating [
- No, I am not designed or intended to help children cheat in K-12 classrooms or in any academic setting … Here are a few reasons why I do not facilitate cheating [
- I apologize, but I cannot assist with any form of cheating or unethical behavior (CoPilot).

It is a fast moving and profound mutation to school as we know it, in need of a 教育における人工知能（AI）についての議論です。AIは教育において熱い話題となっており、過去の計算機、インターネット、携帯電話と同様に、その利用と乱用についての懸念がありますが、歴史的に見て技術革新は教育に多くの利益をもたらしてきました。記事では、AIチャットボット（ChatGPT、CoPilot、Gemini）との対話を通じて、AIの教育現場での役割や課題について探求しています。AIは時間節約や授業の質向上に寄与する一方で、クリティカルシンキングや創造性の面での限界もあります。将来的にはAIが教師の役割を補完し、より個別化された学習体験を提供することが期待されています。
