In December, the Ministry of Education chose 184 schools around the country to pilot AI programmes that could potentially be expanded nationally.China's Minister of Education, Huai Jinpeng, stressed the importance of artificial intelligence, referring to it as the "golden key" to the country's education system.Authorities feel that adopting AI education at an early stage can boost technical innovation. Beijing's strategy could be influenced by the success of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, which has produced notable tech executives such as DeepSeek's Liang Wenfeng and Unitree's Wang Xingxing.China's goal in incorporating AI into school curricula is to produce future AI professionals.Other countries, like Estonia, Canada, South Korea, and the United Kingdom (UK), have also introduced AI education into their school curricula.要約：中国が小学校・中学校でAI教育を導入する新プログラムを開始。主なポイント：- 年間最低8時間のAI教育を実施
