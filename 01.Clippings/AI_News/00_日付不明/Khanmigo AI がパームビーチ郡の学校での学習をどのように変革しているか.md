(CBS12) — Artificial Intelligence used to be seen as a problem in school, raising concerns about cheating and students bypassing the learning process. Palm Beach County Schools are now flipping the narrative, using AI to their advantage.It's called, Khanmigo and Palm Beach County School District said all high schools and middle schools in the county are implementing it in the classroom, helping students with reading, writing, history, math, you name it!"I was always raising my hand because I couldn't just type something up and ask it, Wester Pines Middle School Student, Juliani Romero said."Basically like a little tutor on my computer," Wester Pines Middle School Student, Katerie Kates-Paulus said.The middle school is embracing this AI technology, Khanmigo in their classroom. "It's not going anywhere and we can either embrace it and use it to our advantage to help our students be the best possible students they can be while still teaching them to think critically," Principal of Western Pines Middle School, Philip Preddy said.And that's exactly what they're doing! 6th grade math teacher, Jennifer Barry explained how it works. "It's just a tool for them to be able to ask for help if they don't understand something. Whether it be on their homework, on their classwork, we were using it for data. So those standards that they are weak in that they were asking for help," Barry said.Customizing the questions to exactly what each student needs help with.See also: "Because it asked me like what do I know about rational numbers? I said I don't know. So it's like helping me like basically figure it out more," Kates-Paulus said. "It'll tell you what you're doing wrong and try to implant it into the problem," Romero said.While it teaches the children how to get to the answer ... it never gives it to them. "Walk them through it. You can even type in there, give me the answer, and it will say no. How about we try, and then it'll give them different ways of maybe solving the problem," Barry said.Khanmigo is powered by the non-profit education organization, khan Academy, whose mission is bringing world-class education to anyone — anywhere."It really is, can you solve these real problems of students having gaps in their learning, needing to learn at their own pace, needing support right in the moment. And historically, if you're a middle class, upper middle class, maybe you couldn't afford a tutor. We want to make that accessible to everyone," the founder of Khan Academy, Sal Khan said.Principal Freddy said the data shows students are performing 10% better, thanks to this valuable tool in the classroom.Find more ways to stay up to date with your latest local news.【要約】
パームビーチ郡の学校区では、KhanmigoというAIツールを全ての中学校・高校で導入し、学習支援に活用しています。このツールは読解、作文、歴史、数学など幅広い教科で活用され、生徒一人一人に合わせた学習支援を提供します。主なポイント：
• AIを「問題」ではなく学習支援の「ツール」として活用
• 生徒に答えを直接与えるのではなく、考え方や解き方をガイドする形で支援
• Khan Academyが開発した非営利の教育支援ツール
• 生徒の成績が10%向上したというデータあり
• 教師と生徒の双方から好評を得ているこのシステムの特徴は、単に答えを教えるのではなく、生徒が自分で考えて解答にたどり着けるようサポートすること。また、Khan Academyの理念である「質の高い教育を誰にでも提供する」という目標に沿って、これまで個人チューターを雇える裕福な家庭の子供たちしか受けられなかったような個別指導を、すべての生徒が受けられるようにしています。
