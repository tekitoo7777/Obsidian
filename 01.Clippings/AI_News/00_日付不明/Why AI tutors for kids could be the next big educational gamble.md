Illustration: Aïda Amer/AxiosWhile AI's boosters predict the technology will solve education's most persistent woes by providing personalized AI-powered tutors for K-12 kids, the ed tech trenches harbor plenty of skeptics, too.The big picture: What they're saying: Khan Academy founder Sal Khan- Khan Academy has its own 
- Learners can watch a video (many of them starring Khan) and then ask Khanmigo questions about it — like "I don't understand why A leads to B," or "Two minutes into the video Sal mentioned this. What's he talking about? I don't understand."
- Khan says generative AI is already skilled at answering questions like that: "I would say it's actually comparable to a very good human being in many of those cases."
Yes, but: - Coursera's co-founder Andrew Ng is famous for saying "AI is the new electricity," while others in the field are cautious to the point of banning the tech in schools.
Zoom out:- A key difference between previous waves of ed tech adoption and today's AI boom is that this time, kids are 
- That mirrors YouTube's path to adoption in K-12 classrooms.
By the numbers: - Out of the 231 districts RAND surveyed, only three districts have partnerships with tutoring programs or other software that uses AI to support student learning.
- "We wouldn't underestimate the number of kids using an AI tutor in school," Torney told Axios. "If you look at what the companies say, AI tutors are also in schools."
The case for AI tutors- After moving from Siberia to California, Ivan Crewkov watched his preschool-aged daughter struggle to learn English. This inspired him to build an AI character called Buddy that uses speech recognition to help children practice speaking English.
- "To learn a language, you need to speak it," Crewkov told Axios. English is a mandatory school subject in countries all over the world, but there's also a global teacher shortage. A conversational AI tutor designed specifically for children can help, Crewkov says.
The other side: - Torney told Axios that there was a lot of enthusiasm in the mid-2010s, with people talking about "blended learning, hybrid learning, voice and choice in the curriculum, personalized pathways, and student-centered instruction."
- Those promises haven't panned out, Torney says. "Some people have argued that the last technology that was adopted at scale in the American education system was the chalkboard."
One big obstacle- Buddy.AI focuses on children under 12, and that puts its product into one of technology's most highly regulated areas.
AI proponents say - "The reality is that we need to strike a balance," 
The bottom line: - "If I have to pick between an amazing teacher and no technology or amazing technology, no teacher," Khan says, "I would pick an amazing teacher every time."
