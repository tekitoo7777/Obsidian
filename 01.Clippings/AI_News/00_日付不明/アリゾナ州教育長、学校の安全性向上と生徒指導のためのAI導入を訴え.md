PHOENIX (AZFamily)“This brave police officer prevented the nightmare I have often talked about. Twenty students and additional adults would have lost their lives, and the student’s parents would have had their lives ruined by uncontrollable grief. I know about this because I have lost a child,” said Horne. “Those who have been opposing police in the schools need to rethink this issue. Think of the unimaginable tragedy that would have occurred if that school resource officer had not been there, or if he had been hired a little later.”The schools’ chief said he is urging lawmakers to expand the program this year.Last month, the Arizona Department of Education announced that nearly $50 million in built-up funds would be used to increase the number of armed school resource officers, counselors, and social workers.Arizona’s Family reported that about $39.4 million of the funding will be used for 198 officers and the remaining $8.5 million for counselor or social worker positions.The push for more officers on campus comes at a time when law enforcement agencies across the state and Valley are dealing with significant shortages.### Horne says AI can supplement but not replace teachers
During an interview last week, Horne said the department had a big effort to “get the focus back on academics.” On Tuesday, he called for higher salaries for teachers, including the renewal of Prop 123, which also helps with school funding.The schools’ head says higher salaries will help recruit and retain teachers during this “crisis point.”“Right now, the teacher situation is desperate, and we have absolutely got to raise our teachers salaries,” Horne told the state House Education Committee.In addition, Horne explained that artificial intelligence is one of his top priorities, saying it can help them significantly with tutoring.Studies show the most effective means of teaching is one-on-one tutoring. We cannot afford to hire a million tutors for our million students, but Horne also spoke about 15 initiatives he’s zeroed in on to improve academic performance in public schools.### Horne talks continued push against transgender athletes, critical race theory
This week, Horne also mentioned a need to keep “biological boys out of girls’ sports” amid his ongoing efforts to bar “Biological males have no business in girls’ sports, showers, or locker rooms. I am fighting this battle in court as we speak and pledge to never stop fighting for the right of girls under title IX to compete, excel, and take their rightful place on the winner’s podium,” he said.He also talked about eliminating critical race theory in public school instruction.“I have required the districts and charter schools to answer questions about these kinds of philosophical issues and published their answers on the school report cards. Parents will be informed if the schools are serious about teaching academics or promoting woke ideology. This is important now that parents have choices.”Last year, Horne held a news conference in which he claimed Valley teachers were teaching the concept, citing an example from a book he claimed teachers in Mesa were using.At the time, the superintendent said it was “outrageous” to say the United States is a system of white supremacy, and it was an example of a “typical critical race theory statement.”See a spelling or grammatical error in our story?
