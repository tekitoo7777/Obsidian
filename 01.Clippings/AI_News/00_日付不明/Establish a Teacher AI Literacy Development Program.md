Technology & Innovation day one projectThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technology necessitates a transformation in our educational systems to equip the future workforce with necessary AI skills, starting with our K-12 ecosystem. Congress should establish a dedicated program within the National Science Foundation (NSF) to provide ongoing AI literacy training specifically for K-12 teachers and pre-service teachers. The proposed program would ensure that all teachers have the necessary knowledge and skills to integrate AI into their teaching practices effectively.## Challenge and Opportunity
Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a profoundly disruptive force reshaping the landscape of nearly every industry. This seismic shift demands a corresponding transformation in our educational systems to prepare the next generation effectively. Central to this transformation is building a robust GenAI literacy among students, which begins with equipping our educators. Currently, the integration of GenAI technologies in classrooms is outpacing the preparedness of our teachers, with The urgency for federal intervention cannot be overstated. Without it, there is a significant risk of exacerbating educational and technological disparities among students, which could hinder their readiness for future job markets dominated by AI. It is of particular importance that AI literacy training is deployed equitably to counter the disproportionate impact of AI and automation on women and people of color. McKinsey Global Institute reported in 2023 that The opportunity before us is to establish a government program that will empower teachers to stay relevant and adaptable in an evolving educational landscape. This will not only enhance their professional development but also ensure they can provide high-quality education to their students. Teachers equipped with AI literacy skills will be better prepared to educate students on the importance and applications of AI. This will help students develop critical skills needed for future careers, fostering a workforce that is ready to meet the demands of an AI-driven economy.## Plan of Action
To establish the NSF Teacher AI Literacy Development Program, Congress should first pass a defining piece of legislation that will outline the program’s purpose, delineate its extent, and allocate necessary funding.An initial funding allocation, as specified by the authorizing legislation, will be directed toward establishing the program’s operations. This funding will cover essential aspects such as staffing, the initial setup of the professional development resource hub, and the development of incentive programs for states.Key responsibilities of the program include:Develop comprehensive AI literacy standards for K-12 teachers through a collaborative process involving educational experts, AI specialists, and teachers. Compile a centralized digital repository of AI literacy resources, including training materials, instructional guides, best practices, and case studies.Design a comprehensive grant program to support the development and implementation of AI literacy programs for both in-service and pre-service teachers. Conduct regular, comprehensive assessments to gauge the current state of AI literacy among educators.Conduct nationwide campaigns to raise awareness about the importance of AI literacy in education, prioritizing outreach efforts in underserved and rural areas to ensure that these communities receive the necessary information and resources.Prepare and present annual reports to Congress and the public detailing the program’s achievements, challenges, and future plans.Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of AI literacy programs and assess their impact on teaching practices and student outcomes. ## Proposed Timeline
## Conclusion
This proposal expands upon Section D of the Biden Administration’s We stand at a pivotal moment where our actions today will determine our students’ readiness for the world of tomorrow. Therefore, it is imperative for Congress to act swiftly to pass the necessary legislation to establish the NSF Teacher AI Literacy Development Program. Doing so will not only secure America’s technological leadership but also ensure that every student has the opportunity to succeed in the new digital age.This idea is part of our AI Legislation Policy Sprint. To see all of the policy ideas spanning innovation, education, healthcare, and trust, safety, and privacy, 
この文章は、AI（人工知能）リテラシーの強化を目指して、アメリカの教師向けの研究プログラムを設立する提案について述べています。AIの急速な進歩に対応するため、K-12の教育体系にAIスキルを組み込むことが必要で、そのためには教師たちへのAIリテラシー教育が重要とされています。提案では、国立科学財団（NSF）内に専門のAIリテラシープログラムを設立し、教師たちがAIを効果的に教授するための知識とスキルを習得することを提案しています。このプログラムの具体的な役割としては、K-12の教師向けの包括的なAIリテラシー基準の開発、AIリテラシーリソースの一元化、教師向けのAIリテラシープログラムの開発と実施を支援するための補助金プログラムの設計、教師のAIリテラシーの現状を評価するための定期的な評価、AIリテラシーの重要性についての全国的な啓発活動、プログラムの進捗と成果を詳細に報告すること、AIリテラシープログラムの有効性を評価し、その結果を元に政策決定やプログラムの改善を行うことなどが挙げられています。この提案は、現在の教育格差を緩和し、全ての学生が新しいデジタル時代で成功する機会を持つことを保証するための重要な一歩とされています。
