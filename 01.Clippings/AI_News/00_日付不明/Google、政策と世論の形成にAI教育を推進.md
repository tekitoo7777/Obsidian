Google is hoping to influence policy and shape public perception on AI by focusing on educational programs intended to push AI, also worker retraining programs to familiiarise them with AIGoogle is launching AI education to influence government policyAlphabet’s Google, already facing an to shape public perception and policies on artificial intelligence ahead of a global wave of AI regulation.A key priority, one executive told Reuters, comes in building out “Getting more people and organizations, including governments, familiar with AI and using AI tools, makes for better AI policy and opens up new opportunities – it’s avirtuous cycle,” said Kent Walker, Alphabet’s president of global affairs.As Google races to best Big Tech rivals including Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Meta in the AI arena, it is mindful of the heavy regulatory scrutiny it faces in its existing businesses in advertising and search.In the European Union, Google has offered to sell a part of its ad tech business to appease regulators, Reuters reported. In the U.S., the Justice Department is attempting to force a breakup of its Chrome Web browser — though it may shift course under theadministration of President Donald Trump.Meanwhile, governments globally are drafting new regulations on issues that could be exacerbated by AI, such as copyright and privacy. The EU AI Act, which seeks to assess risk and require disclosures from general-purpose AI systems, has received push back from tech giants that could find themselves in the crosshairs of multibillion-dollar fines.The DOJ has also sought to curtail Google’s advances in AI as a remedy in a federal case that found its search business to be an illegal monopoly.Google executives see an opportunity to shape the narrative around a technology that has stoked emerging fears of mass job loss.CEO Sundar Pichai announced in September a $120 million investment fund to build AI education programs. Deputies including Walker and Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer, are increasingly traveling globally to discuss policy recommendations with governments.“There’s a lot of upside in terms of helping people who may be displaced by this. We do want to focus on that,” Walker said.Efforts include expanding Grow with Google, a website that teaches workers skills like data analysis or IT support that are meant to expand their career prospects in technical fields. In December, the company said 1 million people had obtained a certificate for the program. It is adding specialized courses related to AI, such as one geared toward teachers, said program head Lisa Gevelber.Courses alone are not enough to prepare workers, Walker said. “What really matters is if you have some sort of objective that people are working towards, like a credential that people can use to apply for a job.”Google wants to increase experimentation on public-private partnerships, he said. The leading example so far, he said, is the “Skilled Trades and Readiness” program, in which the company has partnered with community colleges to train workers for potential jobs constructing data centers. Google is incorporating AI education into the program, he said.“Ultimately, the federal government will look and see which proofs of concept are playing out – which of the green shoots are taking root,” Walker said. “If we can help fertilize thateffort, that’s our role.”In the long term, Walker said he expects a small fraction of existing jobs to be entirely displaced by AI, citing several studies commissioned by Google, Goldman Sachs and McKinsey. Those studies suggest AI will be incorporated into most jobs in some capacity.As part of Google’s efforts to prepare for this shift, it hired economist David Autor as a visiting fellow to study the impacts of AI on the workforce. Autor said in an interview thatAI could be used to create more immersive training programs, akin to flight simulators.“The history of adult retraining is not particularly glorious,” he said. “Adults don’t want to go back to class. Classroom training is not going to be the solution to a lot of retraining.”With Reuters inputs記事要約：Googleは、AIに関する政策と世論の形成に影響を与えるため、AI教育プログラムに注力している：- 1億2000万ドルの投資基金を設立し、AI教育プログラムの構築を推進
- 「Grow with Google」などを通じて、データ分析やIT支援などの職業スキル教育を提供
- 地域のコミュニティカレッジと提携し、データセンター建設のための職業訓練プログラムを実施
- AIによる職業への影響について研究を進め、大部分の仕事がAIと統合される形で変化すると予測
この取り組みの背景には、以下の要因がある：- 世界的なAI規制の波に先手を打つ狙い
- 独占禁止法関連の規制圧力への対応
- AI技術による雇用喪失への懸念に対する積極的な対策
Googleは、このような教育プログラムを通じて、AIに関する理解を深め、より良いAI政策の形成につながる「好循環」を生み出すことを目指している。
