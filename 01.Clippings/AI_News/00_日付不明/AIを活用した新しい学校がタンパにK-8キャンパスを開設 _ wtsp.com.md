McKenzie Price created the AI school model after her daughters came home complaining that traditional school was “boring."TAMPA, Fla. — Artificial intelligence is no longer just a concept reserved for tech companies or futuristic films — it’s becoming a cornerstone in how children learn.One of the latest examples is unfolding in Carrollwood, where a new AI-driven school model is reshaping the classroom.Alpha Schools, a pioneering K–8 educational institution that began in Austin, Texas, is now opening a campus in Tampa. The school was founded by McKenzie Price, a mother who set out to revolutionize education after her own daughters came home complaining that traditional school was “boring.”“I wanted a better way for my children,” Price said. “So I started the first Alpha School in 2014. The idea was to make learning more engaging, more personalized, and better suited for the world our kids are growing up in.”Now, local student Kathrine McDonough will be among the first to enroll in Alpha’s Tampa location.“I just love the concept of learning life skills from AI and what it teaches you,” she said.At Alpha Schools, the day begins at 9 a.m. and ends at 3 p.m. The first two hours are dedicated to AI-personalized academics, designed to adapt to each student's pace and level. After that, students transition into hands-on projects and real-world skill development, focusing on areas like leadership, communication, financial literacy and even storytelling.The results so far have been impressive. According to the school, students at Alpha learn twice as fast as their peers, complete an entire grade in just 80 days, and boast an average SAT score of 1474 out of 1600. Since its founding, 98% of Alpha graduates have gone on to attend college.“They’re going to be preparing her for a job that hasn’t even been invented yet,” one parent noted, reflecting on the school’s forward-looking approach.But Alpha isn’t the only one integrating AI into education. Hillsborough County School District has already begun using platforms like Amira Learning — an AI-powered reading tutor — and Magic School AI, which helps teachers automate routine tasks to free up more time for instruction.“There’s a lot being done with AI that’s being used for personalized learning," a parent said.Still, some experts urge a cautious approach. John Licato, a professor at USF’s Bellini College of Artificial Intelligence, says while AI has tremendous potential, it’s not a magic fix.“Some people think all you have to do is plug in AI and it will be perfect because it’s ‘super intelligent.’ But that’s not how it works. It’s a helpful tool, and like any tool, you need to understand its strengths and limitations to use it effectively," he said.As for Kathrine, she’s excited for what lies ahead. Her first day at Alpha Schools in Tampa is Aug. 13.“I’m excited to see the difference,” she said.
