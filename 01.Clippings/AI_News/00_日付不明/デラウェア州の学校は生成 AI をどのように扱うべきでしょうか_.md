Most Delaware students are probably already familiar with generative AI.ChatGPT, for one, launched back in November 2022. Google Bard, now known as Gemini, hit the public last year. These and other large language models have long opened the door to questions on their impact in schools, from K-12 to higher education, and will likely only continue to evolve. This summer, Delaware schools are getting some feedback on how to approach the emerging platforms.In this weekly roundup, we'll catch you up on this and other education updates you may have missed.[## How should schools be handling generative AI? Embrace and caution
ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini — several platforms fueled by generative artificial intelligence have made their way to the mainstream. And, of course, already in the hands of students.Delaware's Department of Education just released guidance last week on AI's “Artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, and, quite honestly, our students sometimes are ahead of us in this realm,” Secretary of Education Mark Holodick said in a press release. “We aim to support our educators with information on what AI is and how it can be safely and ethically integrated into the classroom to support education as well as strategies for addressing academic dishonesty."Benefits included efficiency and speed in data analysis and error reduction, as well as the ability to "personalize content, support student creativity, provide tutoring and help students with critical thinking and future skills." Cautions came in privacy concerns, lack of creativity and ethical concerns. Other risks were plagiarism and cheating, misinformation, social bias, bullying and harassment, overreliance on AI models and unequal access to AI tools.All of this more can be explored on - When selecting a Generative AI tool, carefully review the age restrictions, privacy and data collection policies before implementing them in the classroom.
- Participate in a classroom discussion on plagiarism and establish guidelines forGenerative AI citations.
- Be clear about how and when students are expected to use or not use AI.
- Avoid using AI detection tools as they are proven unreliable, often resulting in false positives.
- Provide instruction on how students can be critical consumers of Generative AI, evaluating responses to see if they meet their needs and verifying facts, figures, quotes and data using reliable sources.
- Consider how Generative AI may be used as a thought partner for students as a brainstorming tool or to provide feedback.
- Ensure equity by making Generative AI tools available to all students, considering that some may and some may not have access outside of school if an assignment permits use.
- Provide a blended learning experience integrating technology with discussions, hands-on learning, and project-based assignments and assessments.
## Indian River schools to get weapons detection systems at high school sports
Weapon screening can now be expected for football and basketball games at Indian River and Sussex Central high schools next school year. The process should come with "minimal inconvenience," according to the district.“It is imperative that we ensure the safety of students, staff and community members at athletic events at our high schools,” said Indian River's Superintendent Jay Owens in a statement.Specific screening procedures may vary depending on the school location. Attendees may need to budget extra time ahead of athletic games for the process. In general, all weapons are prohibited on district property."It is our mission to create a safe, respectful and enjoyable experience for all visitors to our campuses," Owens said in his statement. The district also looked to thank future spectators for their patience.Deep read:## Vo-tech schools look to reduce its carbon footprint by 25% with this project
