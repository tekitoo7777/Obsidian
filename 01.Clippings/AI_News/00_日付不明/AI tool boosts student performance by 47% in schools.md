Story imageData from Education Perfect indicates significant improvements in student performance and engagement following trials of its AI-feedback tool.The educational technology firm conducted trials involving over 100 schools in Australia and New Zealand, engaging nearly 15,000 students and analysing over 200,000 responses. Results from these trials suggest a 47% average improvement in students' final response quality. Additionally, 87% of students reengaged with the AI to enhance low-scoring responses, and 69% of students demonstrated a deeper understanding by their final attempt.Education Perfect's AI-feedback tool provides real-time, personalised feedback, guiding students on how to refine their answers. This process enables students to build confidence and understanding through repeated attempts in a low-pressure environment. "AI has the ability to revolutionise the way students learn by providing timely, actionable feedback," said Shane Smith, Co-founder of Education Perfect. "This technology encourages students to revisit and refine their work in a low-pressure environment, building confidence and driving deeper understanding."The tool also aims to reduce teachers' administrative burdens, allowing them to focus more on direct educational engagement. "Teachers involved in the trial praised the accuracy and insightfulness of the feedback provided by the tool," said Shane. "Rather than replacing teachers, the tool enhances their impact, sparking classroom discussions and freeing up time for more meaningful student interactions."Ethics and data privacy form the backbone of Education Perfect's tool development. The feedback tool complies with government regulations, ensuring stringent data security. It is currently in the process of undergoing certification through Safer Technologies 4 Schools (ST4S). "Protecting student data is our top priority," said Shane. "We've implemented robust safeguards to ensure transparency and compliance, so schools and parents can trust that this technology meets the highest standards for security and ethical use."Education Perfect is committed to accessibility, planning to extend its AI-powered features to government schools in lower ICSEA brackets by 2025, supporting underserved communities. "AI has the potential to bridge these gaps, providing students and schools with the support they need to thrive," said Shane. "It's about ensuring no student is left behind, regardless of their circumstances."## 記事の要約
