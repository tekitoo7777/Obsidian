Salman Khan’s “The book begins by addressing the widespread fears and criticisms surrounding generative AI, particularly in educational contexts. Khan acknowledges the legitimate concerns about AI tools like ChatGPT, such as their potential to encourage cheating, diminish critical thinking, and exacerbate screen time issues. These worries led to numerous educational institutions banning AI applications shortly after their release. However, Khan argues that the issue is not the technology itself but how it is used. He suggests that AI, when employed correctly, can enhance learning rather than hinder it.Khan introduces One of the book’s strengths is Khan’s balanced view of AI’s potential and its pitfalls. He discusses the importance of implementing safeguards to prevent misuse and ensure the technology is used ethically. For instance, OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, has invested in safety measures to prevent the AI from engaging in inappropriate conversations or sharing harmful content. These precautions are crucial in educational settings to protect students and maintain the integrity of the learning process.Khan’s optimism about AI’s potential is infectious. He envisions a future where AI not only aids in academic learning but also supports emotional and social development. AI tutors can provide instant feedback, adapt to individual learning needs, and offer personalized guidance. This can help bridge educational gaps, particularly for students in underserved or remote areas. Moreover, AI can assist teachers by taking over repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus more on interactive and personalized teaching.The book also delves into the broader societal implications of AI in education. Khan discusses how AI can help students develop essential skills for the future workforce. Those who learn to use AI tools effectively will likely have a competitive edge in their careers. By teaching students how to interact with AI, Khan argues, educators can help them become more innovative and adaptable in a rapidly changing job market. However, Khan does not shy away from addressing the potential downsides. He emphasizes the need for continuous human oversight to prevent AI from perpetuating biases or misinformation. The importance of critical thinking and human judgment remains paramount, even as AI tools become more sophisticated.This reviewer found that ‘Brave New Words’ by Salman Khan is a thought-provoking and timely exploration of AI’s potential in education. His insights are both hopeful and pragmatic, offering a roadmap for integrating AI into education in ways that enhance learning while addressing ethical and practical concerns. For educators, policymakers, and anyone interested in the future of education, this book is an essential read that challenges us to rethink how we teach and learn in the digital age.
