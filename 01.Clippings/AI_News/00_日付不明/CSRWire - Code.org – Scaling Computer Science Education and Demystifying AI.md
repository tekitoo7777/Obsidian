Knowing Nevadan math scores were the lowest in the country, Lance sought a way to engage his classes outside of the current curriculum. So, he turned to Code.org.![image_20250519_191837.png](../assets/image_20250519_191837.png)
Teacher at the front of the classroomFounder and CEO Hadi Partovi believes every student in every school should have the chance to learn computer science. Nonprofit Code.org reaches these students with a combination of creating online courses and training existing teachers to teach their own coding classes.Cisco partners with Code.org, helping the foundation provide these courses on their website for free. And with intense global interest in AI, computer science is more relevant than ever before.To spark that computer science interest with Native American Code.org users, product manager Amy Woodman developed a “Star Quilt” module alongside a fellow indigenous teacher. For Lance, the difference in engagement was night and day. “I saw how students were engaged and hands-on from literally day one,” says Lance, whose favorite reaction to hear from his students is, “This is easy!”![image_20250519_191838.png](../assets/image_20250519_191838.png)
