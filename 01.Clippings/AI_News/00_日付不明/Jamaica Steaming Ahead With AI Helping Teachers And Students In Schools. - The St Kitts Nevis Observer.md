The Ministry of Education, Skills, Youth, and Information is using artificial intelligence (AI) to improve learning by focusing on each student’s unique needs and learning styles.“We don’t have to imagine classrooms where technology helps students learn at their own pace anymore. These tools are already here, supported by the Ministry,” said Acting Chief Education Officer, Terry-Ann Thomas-Gayle.She shared this message during the Caribbean Examinations Council’s (CXC) staff awards luncheon in Kingston. The event’s theme was “The Impact of AI on the Education System.”Mrs. Thomas-Gayle talked about various AI tools being used in classrooms that are changing how students learn and how education is measured. These tools are pushing educators to rethink traditional methods.Some of these tools include ALEKS and Knewton Alta, which adjust lessons to match each student’s learning pace and style, and Lexia Core5 Reading and Google’s Read Along, which use interactive methods to engage students.ALEKSThe platform is commonly used for subjects like math, chemistry, and other disciplines where step-by-step mastery is crucial.ALEKS continuously adapts its instruction as students progress, ensuring they build a solid foundation before moving on to more complex topics. Teachers can also track student progress in real time, allowing for targeted support and intervention.Other tools like ASSISTments and Math AI provide quick feedback to help students understand difficult topics, while NoRedInk improves writing skills with focused feedback.She also mentioned administrative tools like Microsoft Copilot, which save teachers time by handling routine tasks, allowing them to focus more on teaching.Mrs. Thomas-Gayle emphasized that AI has many benefits. It helps students learn at their own speed, builds essential tech and problem-solving skills, and gives teachers insights to improve their teaching methods. AI also increases access to high-quality learning resources, even in remote areas.However, she stressed the importance of ensuring all students and schools can use AI tools, so no one is left behind. She also highlighted challenges, such as protecting students’ sensitive data and ensuring teachers receive proper training to use these tools effectively.She praised CXC for over 40 years of shaping education in the region, creating opportunities, and setting high standards. She also encouraged looking to the future, where AI could further enhance education.“This legacy has opened doors for many learners, helping them achieve their goals and contribute to society. As we embrace AI, I am confident that your leadership will ensure these tools are used effectively to support educational growth,” she said.Source: Jamaica GIS
