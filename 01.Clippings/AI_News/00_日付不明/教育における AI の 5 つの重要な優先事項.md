As AI evolves and cements its place in the global economy, educators and stakeholders recognize that in addition to using AI in learning, students will need to develop AI skills and knowledge to succeed in the workforce.The Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) SREB President Stephen L. Pruitt said SREB established the commission to chart a course on how AI is used in classrooms and how to prepare people for a workforce being transformed by technology. The commission, which met June 21, is chaired by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and co-chaired by former Silicon Valley CEO Brad D. Smith, president of Marshall University in West Virginia.“The commission’s approach is to provide leadership to education and the workforce that is thoughtful, strategic, and practical,” Pruitt said. “What we saw in this second meeting is a tsunami of information. Commission members are working to ensure they have the best information and the best recommendations as they lead the work in the South and country.”Here are five takeaways and reflections shared in interviews with commission members immediately following the meeting:Address the ethical and privacy implications of AI first.Commission members emphasized the need to create guidelines that protect student privacy, maintain AI equity and inform K-12 educators and students of the potential risks and benefits of AI.“Ethics should be the rock, the foundation on which AI is built. While AI has tremendous potential for good, if we are not creating it on an ethical framework and including a diverse population in its creation, we risk biases that could have a negative impact.”Build a comprehensive AI framework for K-12 educators and administrators.The SREB region should work to clearly define AI literacy, establish best practices, and create resources for training and support to ensure consistency. In addition, commission members stressed that integrating AI into education requires teachers to adapt to new technologies and teaching methods. Adequate professional development and support, they said, are necessary to ensure that teachers can effectively use AI tools in the classroom.“AI presents an incredible opportunity for educators to combat disinformation. With generative AI tools producing results often with no citations or even fabricated ones, it’s imperative for us to teach students to critically assess information and recognize quality sourcesIntegrate AI through all school disciplines.Preparing students for the future workforce involves teaching them how to use AI tools effectively. Commission members stressed that AI should be integrated across all subject areas, not just computer science. An interdisciplinary approach ensures that students develop a broad understanding of AI and can apply it in various contexts to enhance problem-solving and critical thinking skills​.“AI isn’t taking anything away that shouldn’t have already been done. Now, we can replace those and allow humans to focus on more meaningful work.”Collaborate with industry and deliver students prepared with success skills.Collaboration with industry partners is essential to ensure that the skills taught in schools align with the needs of the workforce. Industry feedback provides real-world context for students. In addition, preparing students by developing “durable” or “soft” skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and ethical reasoning are essential to prepare them for an AI-driven workplace.“AI is a tool like the internet and other forms of technology.Develop clear AI in education policy.State and district policies play a vital role in shaping AI integration in education. Clear policies and guidance can help educators and administrators navigate the complexities of AI, set expectations, and ensure consistent implementation across different areas of a state. (To help states share strategies, SREB has begun publishing a scan of AI “Many of us don’t fully understand AI yet, but SREB has taken a bold step to bring people together and start defining it in various contexts. It’s a tool that will help us, but we need to be aware that it will do things beyond the exact instructions we give it.” –The two-year commission, which launched in April, is tasked with reviewing research and industry data and hearing from experts. It will then develop recommendations for Southern states to lead in:- Using AI in teaching and learning, K-12 and postsecondary
- Developing related policies in K-12 schools, colleges and universities
- Preparing students for careers in AI
