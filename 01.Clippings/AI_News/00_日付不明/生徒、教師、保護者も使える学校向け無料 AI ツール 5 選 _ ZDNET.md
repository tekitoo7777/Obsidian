This back-to-school season features a new, major player: Many people worry that gen AI can harm education by promoting cheating. However, when used properly, these tools have the potential to help students learn more efficiently. They can also help parents and teachers assist students by creating custom materials and explaining complex topics that would appear in homework, study guides, and more.I test AI tools every day, and The key to effectively using AI for schoolwork is identifying the right tools and use cases. Since there are so many tools, I compiled the list below from months of testing to make your life easier.## 1. ChatGPT
 Sabrina Ortiz/ZDNETChatGPT is at the top of my list because of its multiple potential use cases that could improve a student's workflow.As mentioned above, OpenAI's chatbot, launched in November 2022, unleashed a generative craze because its writing, coding, and reasoning capabilities captured people's attention globally. Since then, it has become even better, undergoing major updates that make it even better suited for student use.Also: For example, ChatGPT can ChatGPT can also now ingest other inputs, including documents and images, which students can use to Of course, ChatGPT also has the advanced writing, coding, and mathematical abilities that it is known for, making it a great assistant for all subject assignments, including writing and editing essays, solving and explaining math problems, and generating and debugging code.Some other ways you can use ChatGPT in your studies are:- Answering questions you have about class or materials
- Working through take-home exams or assignments
- Explaining complex topics, such as history, current events, politics, and scientific terms, in a more digestible way
To find the best way to use ChatGPT for your own workflow, I recommend applying it to the use cases discussed above and experimenting with different things.## 2. Quizlet

Building those study sets used to take hours of manual input. Now, AI can do it for you.All a teacher or student has to do is input their notes, whether in the form of a PDF, image, or document and then Quizlet will automatically build the study set that they can use to study.Also: Students can also browse the millions of study sets created by other users. As a student, I found that if I searched Quizlet for a study set about any topic or even a specific textbook, someone else had likely made one.Recently, Quizlet added two features teachers can use to create engaging content for their classrooms: ## 3. Grammarly

It can also offer edits about the actual syntax of your text, offering suggestions to rephrase, rewrite, be more concise, add details, adjust tone, and more. The results are not only more polished work but also an opportunity to learn from the edits.## 4. Duolingo

It also has a streak, leaderboard, league, and point system that motivates learners to want to keep going.I quickly became invested in Duolingo, earning a 245-day streak in an attempt to learn a new language.Also: Foreign language courses are typically mandatory for students throughout their education, starting at the middle school level and going all the way through to college.As if learning a new language isn't already hard, my experiences suggest foreign language courses are not a priority for schools, especially at the younger learning levels, making them under-resourced and sometimes poorly taught.Duolingo would be a great way to bridge the understanding gap that is being created in class. Test yourself on your understanding of the language before an exam, or simply supplement your in-class lessons with some out-of-classroom practice.## 5. Socratic
 Socratic by GoogleAlthough younger learners can benefit from With the Socratic app, students can type in any question about what they are learning in school or upload their worksheets. The app will generate a conversational, human-like response with unique graphics and even related YouTube video links.The app will not just pump out answers or generate essays. Instead, it will give step-by-step explanations and instructions that students can use to get the answer themselves, functioning as an intelligent learning tool.Also: To give parents peace of mind, Socratic also blocks inappropriate questions from being answered.The app isn't limited to younger learners, and Google actually refers to it as a "learning app from Google that helps high school and university students." However, due to its functionality, I would say it's better suited for younger learners because of its limits and fun graphics.
