For two semesters, Corvinus teachers experimented with ChatGPT-like artificial intelligence in their mathematics courses: all the time, their students were free to use AI for their assignments and even for their exams. The results surprised both instructors: students’ motivation and the overall knowledge level of the group decreased, and social inequalities between students became more pronounced.## AI in education
Artificial intelligence could soon completely transform the framework of education, and this process will have a significant negative impact on the common way knowledge is acquired. ## The good ones don’t win
“Bad learners were happy with the easier way to solve problems, while good learners realised that they could achieve the same results with less effort, so they stopped bothering with traditional learning methods,” says Márton Benedek, adding that the important phases of creating, making mistakes and understanding were lost in the learning process when solving problems with AI.In the spring of 2023 – the first time Corvinus faculty members took an AI-enabling course – ChatGPT had only been around for a few months, and only a few students were using the tool. But in their course a year later, almost all students were using ChatGPT-like platforms. Within a year, the use of AI had become so widespread and the tools so sophisticated that the majority of students had blindly trusted them without even trying to understand the process that led to the solution of the tasks.“Artificial intelligence has replaced the process of finding solutions to problems, when in the process of knowledge acquisition, understanding the process would have been much more important than the solution itself,” explains Balázs R. Sziklai. He noted that most of the students who passed the exam with perfect scores using AI had no idea how they had performed between 0% and 100% until they received their scores.## Preference for talented students
Moreover, in addition to reducing the overall level of knowledge and motivation of students, intensive use of AI can also exacerbate social inequalities between students. Indeed, more affluent students who have access to more advanced subscription versions of ChatGPT-like tools can produce much better submissions than their peers who use the free versions.Despite their negative experiences, Márton Benedek and Balázs Sziklai R. do not see the solution in banning AI-based tools, but they consider it necessary to limit the use of AI-based tools in education: “the ideal goal, in our opinion, would be for students to be able to use these tools while being aware of the basis on which ChatGPT produces a solution, and to be able to detect and correct errors made by AI in solving a task. We have found that if a student just pressed the START button and trusted ChatGPT completely, he or she could not assess the severity of the problem and was not sure whether ChatGPT was providing the correct solution,” adds Balázs Sziklai.read also:- AI Summit Budapest 2024: innovations in artificial intelligence draw record crowds –

Featured picture: この記事は、ハンガリーのコルヴィヌス大学の教員が行った、数学の授業でAIツールの使用を許可する実験について報告しています。主なポイントは以下の通りです：- 2学期にわたり、学生たちはChatGPTのようなAIツールを自由に使用することが許可されました。
- 予想に反して、学生の動機付けと全体的な知識レベルが低下しました。
- AIの使用により、問題解決の過程での「創造」「失敗」「理解」という重要な段階が失われました。
- 1年間で、ほぼ全ての学生がAIツールを使用するようになり、多くの学生がAIの解答を盲目的に信頼するようになりました。
- 社会的不平等が拡大する可能性が示唆されました。高度なAIツールにアクセスできる裕福な学生が有利になる傾向がありました。
- 教員たちは、AIツールの使用を完全に禁止するのではなく、制限付きでの使用を提案しています。学生がAIの仕組みを理解し、エラーを検出・修正できるようになることが理想的だと考えています。
この実験結果は、教育におけるAI利用の潜在的な危険性と、適切な利用方法の重要性を示唆しています。【AIを教育に使用した結果】ハンガリーの大学で、数学の授業でAI使用を許可した実験の結果が衝撃的😱✅学生の動機付けと知識レベルが低下✅問題解決過程での「創造」「失敗」「理解」が消失✅社会的不平等が拡大の可能性✅AIの盲目的信頼が増加教育でのAI利用、メリットだけじゃない！適切な使用方法の確立が急務です🤖📚#AI #教育 #ChatGPT #学習
