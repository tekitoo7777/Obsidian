Creative Applications of Artificial Intelligence in EducationIn just 192 pages, editors Alex Urmeneta and Margarida Romero deliver a succinct and comprehensive exploration of AI use cases in elementary, secondary and postsecondary environments, including applications in vocational training and administrative functions.Many of the contributors and case studies in the book draw from European perspectives, but the central issues and questions are relevant in our North American context.The book identifies several risks associated with AI in education, including the potential reduction in agency, choice and decision-making autonomy for teachers and students. The contributors caution against the decline in critical skills due to overreliance on AI systems, and highlight ethical concerns related to surveillance, data privacy, bias and accountability.On the positive side, the book notes the benefits of AI in automating routine tasks, allowing teachers to focus on more meaningful interactions with students. It also discusses the potential of AI to enhance language learning, provide personalized feedback, and support dynamic learning environments through AI integration in game-based learning and simulations.However, the primary theme of the book is the importance of preserving human agency and ensuring transparency in the deployment of AI applications in education settings. Contributors emphasize the need for critical engagement with AI tools in education, predicated on a strong foundation of technical training and AI literacy. The authors advocate for a thoughtful integration of AI, emphasizing hybrid intelligence, where AI complements rather than replaces human intelligence. The book introduces useful frameworks such as the passive participatory model of AI and digital acculturation, which help educators understand how AI engagement and integration may progress.The contributors also provide several important recommendations for educators and policymakers, in addition to their focus on preserving human agency in AI applications. These include:- Transparency
- Formative assessment
- AI literacy training
- Ethical guidelines
All recommendations emphasize the role of senior academic leaders in governance and operational aspects of AI deployment. It is critical that leaders establish policies and protocols to ensure transparency, accountability, security and equitable access. A focus on training and ongoing support for users to enhance AI literacy and skill development is essential for successful AI integration in teaching, learning, research, and administrative contexts.Underscoring the central importance of human judgment, wisdom, and relationships in education, Emily Tufts is the University Librarian at Trent University.- Twitter
