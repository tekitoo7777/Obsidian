This strategic focus will aim at improving operational efficiencies through AI-driven analytics and automation, streamlining everything from resource allocation to student attendance and engagement tracking."To demystify AI and unlock its potential across educational settings, we will see a surge in 'AI 101' professional development courses for educators. These sessions will provide a fundamental understanding of AI and explore its benefits and risks within an educational framework. Such initiatives will equip educators with the knowledge to critically assess the role of AI in education and its ethical implications."Additionally, more educators will harness AI to refine and differentiate their instructional design, using adaptive learning technologies to tailor lessons to the varied learning styles and needs of students. This personalized approach will enable more effective teaching, catering to individual student needs at scale and fostering a more inclusive learning environment."Through these initiatives, school systems will enhance their operational capacities and empower educators to leverage AI in innovative ways that improve educational outcomes and operational efficiencies."— Dr. Leslie Torres-Rodriguez, superintendent, "In 2025, I predict we'll see a rise in state and federal legislation around the use of artificial intelligence in classrooms. But even with the best intentions, legislators may end up inadvertently putting up barriers for tools that are actually helping students learn. It's going to be incredibly important for institutions and policymakers to truly understand the difference between generative AI tools — which may compromise the learning process or lack the proper technological safety systems to be appropriate for student use —and learning tools that incorporate safe and tested algorithms to support authentic teaching and learning workflows."— Kelsey Behringer, CEO, "AI is revolutionizing our world and education must keep pace. As this technology becomes increasingly central to workforce, innovation, and economic opportunity, we must transform the way we prepare students for that future. All students must also be provided with the opportunity to learn how to use AI effectively, ethically, and safely."— Andrew Flood, CEO, "The future of AI in K-12 education is as promising as it is transformative. AI can automate administrative tasks, which means more time for our teachers to focus on instruction and student interaction. Schools will also look to AI to personalize the learning experiences, adapting to each student’s pace and style, making learning more engaging, meaningful, and effective. Educational applications now have intelligent tutoring built in to provide instant feedback, which is a game changer for the learning process. AI-driven analytics can identify learning gaps and suggest targeted interventions or differentiators for student needs, ensuring all students are appropriately supported and adequately challenged. The important crux of successful AI integration, as with most educational technology initiatives, is the integration and teachers' professional development. Overall, AI has the potential to revolutionize schools, making it more personalized, efficient, and inclusive on a path to equity in education."— Lisa Irey, director of technology & printing services, Case Systems makerspace![image_20250519_191500.png](../assets/image_20250519_191500.png)

"Artificial intelligence is transforming K-12 education, reshaping how teachers support students. In 2025, we'll see educators continue to expand their use of AI in classrooms, and when it comes to literacy instruction, we'll see more reliance on tools that free up educators time while offering valuable insights to guide 1:1 instruction. Far from just a tool for automation, AI is emerging as an ally in human-centered teaching, empowering educators to focus on what matters most: nurturing student relationships and delivering high-quality instruction. By embracing AI thoughtfully, educators can enhance learning and prepare students to see AI as a tool for positive change."— "In 2025, as AI tools and adoption mature, I predict a shift in substance over flash in the ed tech product market. Innovative companies have been using AI for some time, and the potential is immense. Yet, in the race to seem relevant, many companies prioritized being the first — not the best — to market with educator- and student-facing AI solutions. The next phase will weed out which companies are truly leading the way with impactful, research-backed applications."As we move forward, ed tech companies will be forced to refine their products, aligning AI with effective teaching strategies, personalized learning paths, and improved outcomes. Rather than offering niche features, companies will need to prioritize systems that foster high-quality learning, meaningful engagement, and better educational experiences for all kids."— Amanda Kocon, chief strategy officer, "AI technologies will continue to transform how teachers support students and grow professionally. Personally, tools like — Joe Ackerman, 5th grade teacher, "As AI tools get smarter, humans are getting smarter about how to use them. In 2025, we'll see more examples of AI creating efficiencies for students, educators, and education companies. AI can help students find sources. With help from AI, they'll spend less time searching for information, and more time reading and synthesizing. For educators, AI will automate time-consuming logistics so they can focus on instruction. For education companies, AI will support scalable quality improvements that will enhance the student experience.stylized illustration of an elementary school classroom under construction![image_20250519_191502.png](../assets/image_20250519_191502.png)

This integration will also prompt districts and schools to adopt solutions that have a proven track record in protecting student privacy and security. In education, technology remains a powerful tool, but teaching, learning, and safety always come first."— "AI is already being used by many educators, not just to gain efficiencies, but to make a real difference in how their students are learning. I suspect in 2025 we'll see even more educators experimenting and leveraging AI tools as they evolve — especially as more of the Gen Z population enters the teaching workforce."In 2024, surveyed K-12 — John Jorgenson, CMO, "The initial hype phase of AI will be over in 2025 — which is good news. Educators will stop feeling FOMO and start assessing AI for how it can truly support teachers and deliver better student outcomes. In 2025, educators will become more discerning about the benefits and limitations of AI. They will expect more detailed and clarifying answers about concerns like privacy — what data does your AI share with third party companies — and accuracy — how often do you test and refine your AI? This new phase of AI is exciting to me. It matters to me that educators understand that AI learns by example and if not built responsibly and ethically it can be biased and damaging for students. If AI doesn't work equally for every student, it doesn't work."— Amelia Kelly, chief technology officer, stylized illustration of an elementary school classroom under constructionlaptop on a clean desk with colorful image icons dynamically emanating from the screenpattern featuring interconnected lines, nodes, lock icons, and cogwheels## 記事の要約
