Education & Workforce day one projectThe next presidential administration should - An Introduction to AI, Data Literacy, and Data Science
- AI & Data Science Pedagogy
- AI and Data Science for Curriculum Development & Improvement
- Using AI Tools for Differentiation, Assessment & Feedback
- Data Science for Ethical AI Use
In addition, this resource center would develop and host free, pre-recorded, virtual training sessions to support educators and district professionals to better understand these resources and practices so they can bring them back to their contexts. This work would improve teacher practice and cut administrative burdens. A teacher education resource would lessen the digital divide and ensure that our educators are prepared to support their students in understanding how to use AI tools so that each and every student can be college and career ready and competitive at the global level. This resource center would be developed using a process similar to the ## Challenge and Opportunity
AI is an incredible technology that has the power to revolutionize many areas, especially how educators teach and prepare the next generation to be competitive in higher education and the workforce. A If the teachers themselves do not have enough professional development or expertise to select and teach new technology, they cannot be expected to thoroughly prepare their students to understand emerging technologies, such as AI, nor the underpinning concepts necessary to understand these technologies, Whether students aren’t getting the content because it isn’t given its due priority, or becauseThe United States finds itself at a crossroads in the global data boom. Demand in the economic marketplace, and threat to national security by way of artificial intelligence and mal-, mis-, and disinformation, have educators facing an urgent problem in need of an immediate solution. In August of 1958, 66 years ago, Congress passed the## Plan of Action
In the years since the Space Race, one problem with STEM education persists: K-12 classrooms still teach students largely the same content; for example, the progression of high school mathematics including algebra, geometry, and trigonometry Previously, the Department of Education has created resource repositories to support the dissemination of information to the larger educational praxis and research community. One such example is the To combat this, we suggest the creation of something similar to the WWC, with a focus on vetted materials for educator and student learning around AI and Data Science. We propose the creation of the For example, the RFI might request example materials or lesson goals for the following subjects:- An Introduction to AI, Data Literacy, and Data Science 
- AI & Data Science Pedagogy
- AI and Data Science for Curriculum Development & Improvement
- Using AI Tools for Differentiation, Assessment & Feedback
- Data Science for Safe and Ethical AI Use
- Characteristics of Potentially Biased Algorithms and Their Shortcomings
A framework for evaluating how useful these contributions might be for the Teacher Education Clearinghouse would consider the following principles:- Accuracy and relevance to subject matter
- Availability of existing resources vs. creation of new resources
- Ease of instructor use
- Likely classroom efficacy
- Safety, responsible use, and fairness of proposed tool/application/lesson
Additionally, this would also include a series of quick start guide books that would be broken down by topic and include a set of resources around foundational topics such as, “Introduction to AI” and “Foundational Data Science Vocabulary”.When complete, this process would result in a national resource library, which would house a free series of asynchronous professional learning opportunities and classroom materials, activities, and datasets. This work could be promoted through the larger DoE as well as through the Regional Educational Laboratory program and state level stakeholders. The professional learning would consist of prerecorded virtual trainings and related materials (ex: slide decks, videos, interactive components of lessons, etc.). The materials would include educator-facing materials to support their professional development in Big Data and AI alongside student-facing lessons on AI Literacy that teachers could use to support their students. All materials would be publicly available for download on an ED-owned website. This will allow educators from any district, and any level of experience, to access materials that will improve their understanding and pedagogy. This especially benefits educators from less resourced environments because they can still access the training they need to adequately support their students, regardless of local capacity for potentially expensive training and resource acquisition. Now is the time to create such a resource center because there currently isn’t a set of vetted and reliable resources that are available and accessible to the larger educator community and teachers desperately need these resources to support themselves and their students in using these tools thoughtfully and safely. The successful development of this resource center would result in increased educator understanding of AI and data science such that the standing of U.S. students increases on such international measurements as the ## Conclusion
The field of education is at a turning point; the rise of advancements in AI and Big Data necessitate increased focus on these areas in the K-12 classroom; however, most educators do not have the preparation needed to adequately teach these topics to fully prepare their students. For the United States to continue to be a competitive global power in technology and innovation, we need a workforce that understands how to use, apply, and develop new innovations using AI and Data Science. This proposal for a library of high quality, open-source, vetted materials would support democratization of professional development for all educators and their students.
