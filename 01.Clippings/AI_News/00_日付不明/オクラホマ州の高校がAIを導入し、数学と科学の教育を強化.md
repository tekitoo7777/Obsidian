STILLWATER, Okla. —Enid High School in Oklahoma is using artificial intelligence software to help students learn math and science, as part of a pilot program initiated by Oklahoma State University.>> Four hundred students at Enid High School now use the AI software "Khanmigo" every school day to assist with their math and science lessons. Khanmigo combines the tutoring software Khan Academy with ChatGPT, providing students with interactive support as they work through problems."It works more like a teacher. It doesn't give them a direct answer. It'll say, that's great. So where should we start? And it will continue to ask them questions like that. Now as a teacher, I think it's great. Students don't like it because they want the automatic answer,” said Stephanie Garis, head of the high school’s math department."It makes you do a little bit more work. It kind of gets annoying,” said Shawn West, a student.Despite some students finding it annoying, others appreciate the interactive nature of the software."If you actually struggle on the problem, you can also like ask your classmates and like you just like basically just help each other,” said Mayra Lopez Ramirez, a student."For one, it gives us a chance to identify learning gaps. Those gaps can come from a variety of reasons. It could be because of the pandemic. It could be because of students who come to us from different states or different communities,” said Tyler Elders, an instructional coach."We're hoping to see some better outcomes in our academic success in math, especially with our ACT this year, because we've had a full year of implementation in our math department,” said Shannon Crowley, secondary education curriculum director.Students have been using the program for about a year in geometry and algebra, and in some science classes since August."The supports are in place. We believe we've got a fantastic staff that now with this too as well. 24 seven on the Chromebook, students can be super successful,” said Principal Craig Lindell.Get the latest news stories of interest by clicking here.Once the school year is over, test scores will be reviewed to better track the impacts of the program. Garis mentioned that the software could eventually plan entire lessons, saving even more time for teachers.Top Headlines
