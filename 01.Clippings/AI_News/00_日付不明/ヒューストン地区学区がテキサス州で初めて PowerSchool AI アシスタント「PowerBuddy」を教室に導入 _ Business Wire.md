FOLSOM, Calif.--(“PowerBuddy will lighten the load on our teachers, give our students a helping hand, and save time for everyone so that deeper learning can occur within each lesson,” said Dr. Martha Salazar-Zamora, Superintendent, Tomball Independent School District. “PowerSchool’s commitment to responsible AI and its natural integration with our existing edtech products made the decision to add PowerBuddy an easy one for our district.”PowerBuddy for Learning operates within PowerBuddy will bring AI to Tomball ISD’s existing data within Schoology Learning instead of requiring the district to send its data to the AI. This promotes a more robust experience for students and teachers and heightens the security and privacy of the district’s AI usage while delivering personalized insights, fostering engagement, and creating a more supportive teaching and learning environment.PowerBuddy for Custom AI is a cutting-edge AI assistant allowing users to ask specific questions and receive accurate, approved answers, providing unencumbered access to district-specific information through natural language prompts. Users can more effortlessly find important details from district and school information such as policy manuals, athletic schedules, after-school programs, student handbooks, district calendars, lunch menus, job postings and more with the help of PowerBuddy for Custom AI.In addition to PowerBuddy for Learning and PowerBuddy for Custom AI, Tomball ISD also partners with PowerSchool to provide members of their district with several additional products, including Applicant Tracking, Employee Records, eSchoolPlus SIS, eFinancePlus, and Predictive Enrollment Analytics.Tomball Independent School District is in Harris County, Texas, northwest of Houston.
