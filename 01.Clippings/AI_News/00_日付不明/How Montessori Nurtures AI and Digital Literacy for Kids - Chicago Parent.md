Middle school students atThe kids’ verdict? The bot didn’t measure up.“They learned AI can be a good thought partner,” explains Samantha Gleisten, the school’s innovation and technology coordinator. “But to make it really good, they have to interact with the AI. It’s about starting a conversation and finishing it, adding their own special sauce at the end.”This is one way this Chicago school for ages 2-14 brings AI literacy to life. “Technology use at our Montessori school is very intentional,” Gleisten says. Kids discover concepts gradually, staying rooted in Montessori’s hands-on, exploratory learning style.### 1. Laying critical thinking groundwork for digital literacy

At Rogers Park, this curiosity-led approach starts by engaging toddlers through grade 3 in a screen-free approach.“Even at the youngest ages, we’re helping students think critically about how tech works,” Younger kids may work with toy animals, for example, grouping them into categories like vertebrates and invertebrates. “What they’re actually doing is organizing data sets,” Gleisten explains. “But if you then ask kids to sort them into ‘happy’ and ‘sad,’ now you’re introducing bias.”And bias is a crucial concept for kids to grasp as they learn how AI processes and interprets information.### 2. Teaching AI literacy through interactive lessons

1. インタラクティブなAIリテラシー教育：4年生以降、AIツールの実践的な使用と限界の理解
1. 責任あるデジタル市民の育成：デジタル世界での倫理的行動とバランスの重要性を強調
1. 保護者との連携：家庭でのテクノロジー使用に関する指針提供と対話の促進
この approach は、AIを単なるツールとしてではなく、批判的に理解し、創造的に活用する能力を育てることを目指しています。
