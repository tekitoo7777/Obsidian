It wasn't so much the art that compelled me; I loved the distinctive smell and visceral feel of the fingerpaint. The entire process felt like an exploration, and through it, I discovered my creativity.It was messy, chaotic, and crucial, I think, for my development. The It's clean, antiseptic, terrible, and a metaphor for what I think AI might be doing to learning.You may like-  AI slop is taking over the internet and I've had enough of it

My concerns were sparked anew by a recent and well-researched story in It's full of details and anecdotes about how teachers are turning to AI in the classroom to help students, for instance, ideate. One teacher complained that the kids' essay ideas were growing "stale," so she's having them use AI to help them come up with better ones.## Antiseptic AI learning
Forget brainstorming in the classroom, kicking around ideas big and small that might spark others. AI offers a valuable shortcut. It also cuts out the messiness of bad ideas. AI's job is not to come up with answers randomly. The Large Language Models (LLMs) in I often describe this as AI's knowing better than us "what comes next." That works in reading, writing, coding, and art. It's not always a clean process, though.Early AIs (ones from 12 months ago) with somewhat limited training didn't always understand that humans have five fingers on each hand, so we got six fingers and sometimes extra phantom limbs. Interestingly, we seem quite comfortable with AI's learning through their own messy mistakes.Literacy, the report notes, is dropping among grade school children largely because they're doing less reading of long-form content – they mostly read stuff on small screens if they're not ingesting endless video scrolls – and the pandemic set almost all learning back by a few years.![image_20250519_191326.png](../assets/image_20250519_191326.png)

While boomers and Gen X might have used encyclopedias, Millennials and Gen Z have largely grown up using the web as a core research tool. They learned how to search on AI, though, is a conversation where the response is presented as fact, and the student assumes it is so. There is no error or assumption of error, and mistakes could easily be hidden in AI hallucinations.Again, the engagement with a teacher and even other students is lost. Ideas no longer float in the ether. Questions are not shared among a group.## Let's make mistakes
Good teachers used to say, "There's no such thing as a dumb question." Asking "dumb" questions was how we learned. Students using AI are shielded from that moment. They just type in the prompt and the AI responds.We learn through trial and error, and studies have shown that young minds, in particular, need to learn from the messiness of mistakes.In a 2016 study, A world in which students are potentially paired with their own AI There is an exploration lost for the student who will not learn about the right way and understand how that error might lead to other reasoning dead ends and for the teacher who will fail to learn about the best way to engage and teach that student.The sad thing is that I'm not sure we can convince students and their parents that this lack of messiness, error-making, and feedback loops will harm the students.Outside the classroom, students teach themselves how to use The sad thing is that I'm not sure we can convince students and their parents that this lack of messiness, error-making, and feedback loops will harm the students. They will not learn as much, and I'm pretty sure their intellectual curiosity and creativity will be stunted.How do we learn fresh things when our teacher is an AI, one that's been trained on all that was and is still not that good at telling us what comes next?Look, I am not anti-AI, but AI in the hands of children and young students is like the sealed fingerpainting kit: antiseptic, wrong, and the opposite of the beautiful mess that is learning.### You might also like

この記事は、教室でのAI使用に関する懸念を表明しています。主なポイントは：- AIが学習プロセスから「失敗から学ぶ機会」を奪っているという懸念
- 教師たちがアイデア出しやリサーチにAIを使用し始めており、従来の brainstorming や対話的な学習方法が失われつつある
- AIとの対話は事実として受け止められやすく、批判的思考や試行錯誤の機会が減少
- 学生の読解力低下や長文離れが進む中、AIが「簡単な解決策」として使われている現状
著者は、指や paint が直接触れ合わない新しい fingerpainting キットを比喩として用い、AIが学習から「必要な混沌や失敗」を取り除いてしまう危険性を指摘しています。結論として、AIは有用なツールだが、若い学習者の手に渡ると、創造性や知的好奇心の発達を妨げる可能性があると警告しています。
