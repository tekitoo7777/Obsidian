Sarah Cooper teaches 8th grade U.S. history and civics and is the associate head of school at Flintridge Preparatory School in La Canada, Calif. She is the author of two books, During the past school year, I wanted my 8th grade civics classes to be a place where students could experiment creatively with AI through large language models and image generators. I believe that AI is increasingly a helpful co-intelligence (as the title of an excellent As a result, in the directions for each major assignment, I included a section on At the end of the year, when each student picked seven out of several dozen prompts for a digital portfolio project, about a quarter responded to this one: “If you used AI in this class at all, describe what you did and how it was helpful or not helpful. Include how you might want to use AI ethically in your classes in the future.”Here are some patterns of use they described, which helped me—as much as them—imagine the many possibilities for thinking along with AI:Clarifying Concepts:Creating Visual Cues: Cleaning Up Writing: Finally, these 8th graders offered cautions and reflections. Some were fundamental: “The only thing I don’t like is that ChatGPT sometimes get info wrong or doesn’t know where it got a quote from” and “AI had a hard time adding quotes from the text when I asked it to, and also when I asked for more statistics from the article that were very clearly written.”Others tilted utilitarian: “I see myself using AI to help check my writing because it’s easy to use and I can manipulate it with my own instructions” and “When using AI, it was difficult to find ways to utilize it where it wasn’t doing all the work, rather just assisting in understanding.” And still others waxed existential: “I knew AI was advancing. … I just never fully realized its advanced, almost overpowering capability. In conclusion, AI is a valuable tool that should be used responsibly.” Amen to that!## Applying the 80/20 Rule
Adam Moler is a middle school social studies teacher with experience in creating technology-infused lessons and is recognized as a district and state leader in innovative social studies instruction:As an 8th grade social studies teacher, I have found artificial intelligence to be a powerful tool for enhancing my students’ learning experience. By leveraging AI technologies, I have been able to create engaging, personalized lessons that cater to the diverse needs of my students.One of the most significant benefits of AI is its ability to generate personalized content. Using AI tools like I prompted the AI with our unit’s essential question, “How is our Constitution a model for limited government?” and mentioned the key concepts we had covered, such as popular sovereignty, federalism, separation of powers, checks and balances, individual rights, and limited government. Claude AI then generated a personalized article that connected these concepts to our specific classroom experiences.However, it’s crucial to remember that while AI can handle a significant portion of the content creation process, it’s not perfect. That’s where the 80/20 rule comes in: I aim to have AI generate around 80 percent of the initial content, but I always dedicate about 20 percent of my time to carefully reviewing, editing, and refining the AI-generated material. This ensures the final product is accurate, appropriate, and aligns with my learning objectives.For instance, when using AI to create the Constitution article, I carefully reviewed the generated text to check for accuracy, clarity, and coherence. I made necessary edits to improve the flow of ideas, added examples to clarify key points, and ensured the language was suitable for my 8th graders. By combining the efficiency of AI with the critical eye of a human educator, I can create high-quality, personalized content that effectively supports student learning.AI has also been invaluable in helping me provide differentiated instruction. When students miss class, I use AI to create review articles and activities to help them catch up. For instance, if a student misses a lesson on the Bill of Rights, I can input the key amendments and concepts into a Moreover, AI allows me to differentiate content based on students’ individual needs and interests. For example, I can tailor readings to match their Lexile levels, ensuring that the material is challenging but not overwhelming. Before generating, or converting, texts to different Lexile levels, I ask AI, “What do you know about Lexile levels?” Seeing what AI knows first will lead to better, accurate results. Additionally, I can use AI to generate articles in a tone that resonates with my students, such as having an AI tool explain a concept in the same style as a popular celebrity or relate it to a topic they’re passionate about, like football. By leveraging AI to create content that speaks directly to my students’ interests and abilities, I can increase engagement and make learning more relevant and enjoyable for them.Additionally, I use AI to provide targeted feedback to students. After a CyberSandwich activity where students wrote paragraphs on how the Constitution exemplifies limited government, I had AI scan their work and compare it to earlier writing samples. The AI analyzed factors like evidence use, paragraph structure, and coherence. I then reviewed the AI’s analysis, verifying accuracy and adding my insights. This allowed me to track progress and identify areas for improvement, which I shared with my students through Google Classroom. By leveraging AI’s capabilities and combining them with my expertise, I can provide frequent, detailed feedback to support students’ growth with the skill of writing.AI is also valuable for lesson planning. When I need engaging activities or fresh approaches to complex concepts, I turn to AI for inspiration. For instance, I used AI to adapt an escape-room activity when teaching checks and balances. I input the details and objectives, and the AI suggested tweaks to the guided notes, assessment questions, and Google form locks. I reviewed the suggestions, selecting the most relevant and effective ideas to fit my students’ needs. By collaborating with AI and applying my judgment, I created a customized, interactive learning experience that resonated with my students.While AI offers numerous benefits, it’s crucial to use these tools responsibly and ethically. I always carefully review AI-generated content for accuracy and appropriateness, double-checking against reliable sources. Additionally, I use AI to supplement, not replace, my expertise as an educator. AI provides valuable insights, but ultimately, I make informed decisions about the content and activities that will best support my students’ learning.Integrating AI into my 8th-grade social studies classroom has been a game-changer. By leveraging AI to create personalized content, differentiate instruction, provide targeted feedback, and enhance lesson planning, I have created a more engaging and effective learning environment. The key is to find the right balance—letting AI handle a significant portion of the workload but always dedicating time to critically review, refine, and adapt the generated materials.As AI continues to evolve, I’m excited to explore new ways to harness its potential to support student success and make learning more accessible and impactful. I encourage fellow educators to experiment with AI but to approach it with care and judgment. By embracing AI as a partner and applying the 80/20 rule, we can unlock new possibilities for student learning and growth while maintaining the essential human element at the heart of teaching.## ‘Creating Literacy Resources’
Meghan Hargrave is an experienced educator with over 15 years in the field and expertise in integrating artificial intelligence tools in the classroom. An international presenter and educational consultant, she has taught at Teachers College, Columbia University, regularly contributes to popular educational publications, and shares effective classroom strategies via social media @letmeknowhowitgoes:Artificial Intelligence has become a key tool for creating literacy resources for teaching foundational skills. For several years, I have been working to enhance the teaching of these skills but, because of lack of resources, have found myself writing decodable texts, creating word sorts, making word ladders, and often settling for materials that “kind of” worked.Now, AI helps me quickly generate decodable passages on needed skills and relevant topics, shared reading passages aligned with reading skills and content area topics, and multiple versions of texts to match a range of interests. Although it sometimes requires a few rounds of prompting or some revisions, AI has greatly improved our ability to create engaging and appropriate resources for students. Through the prompting, I have found that I am much clearer on what it is I am looking for and in turn have more clarity on what students need.This said, I do not use AI as a stand-alone answer to any specific foundational-skill questions and do not fully trust it to create foundational-skill resources. I use it to get started but always analyze the output and often have to reprompt or make my own edits. It knows basic phonics, but I do not use it as a resource for teaching about phonics—it isn’t the expert on r-controlled vowels or routines for teaching high-frequency words. I still rely on research-based resources for teaching these foundational skills. AI assists in resource creation but does not replace the depth of traditional educational methods.Thanks to Sarah, Adam, and Meghan for contributing their thoughts!Consider contributing a question to be answered in a future post.
