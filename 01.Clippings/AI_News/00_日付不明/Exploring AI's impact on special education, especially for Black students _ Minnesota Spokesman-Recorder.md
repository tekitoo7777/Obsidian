Studies also show that, of the nation’s roughly 7.5 million special education students, nearly 2 in 10 are Black.Given the nationwide shortage of special education teachers, it makes sense that some districts would outsource some of their duties to a robot— namely, artificial intelligence. Powerful computer programs can help write lesson plans and customize them for individual students’ needs, among other things.With AI technology changing every day, education professionals are working diligently to dissect its role in K-12. Part of that research examines how AI shows up in special education and its impact on students with disabilities, especially Black students with disabilities.Although it may seem like a godsend to stressed-out SpEd teachers and students with different learning abilities, experts say it’s unclear whether AI is a help or hindrance for Black special-education students. One big issue: The lack of people of color in AI development, a problem that often means technology that has racial and cultural blind spots.“I work with product developers that are investigating ways that their products and features of their products can specifically impact Black, Latino, and students experiencing high poverty,” says Shayla Cornick, director of research and development at Digital Promise, a nonprofit education organization. “And what they’re trying to do is look for ways to increase motivation, engagement and persistence of these students.”In the 2022-23 school year, 15% of all public school students received special education or related services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). From interactive online lesson plans to ways families can check their student’s progress, AI already plays a role in special education. That’s why experts believe families also need to be a part of the conversation on how the latest tech is deployed in the classroom.Incorporating AI into SpEdCornick — and many others advocating for inclusion — say the scarcity of representation in tech can trickle down to marginalized students like students with disabilities. Most students engage with AI through platforms like ClassDojo, which keeps them informed about lessons, and Kahoot!, which encourages classroom engagement and participation.Platforms like Digital Promise have tools like the Learner Variability Project, which creates guides for educators and students with unique needs.“Being able to customize dialects, being able to customize imagery and the environment around them to learn in really cool ways — it’s really interesting and exciting to hear and see,” Cornick says. “I’m also seeing them doing a lot with having the tools to adjust to the behaviors of the students.”However, teachers need to be aware that not all AI tools will work for all students. And racial bias can also show up in AI-generated responses and images.“There is a lot of backdoor stuff happening with AI around who’s creating the models and what that process looks like,” Cornick says. “So I think there should be a level of transparency that product developers provide around how and if AI has been used in teachers’ work.”Aziah Siid is a journalist with a background in K-12 teaching, aiding young individuals with disabilities, and improving underserved schools.### Your Might Also Like
