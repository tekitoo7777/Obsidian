Students at Arizona's new Unbound Academy wills pend just two hours a day on academics, all taught by AI.Remember that one teacher who made going to school fun and inspired you to pursue your passions? Students at a new charter school in Arizona won’t, because they don’t get to have teachers. Instead, the two hours of academic instruction they receive each day—yes, just two hours—will be directed entirely by AI.By a 4-3 margin, the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools on Monday Under the 2hr Learning model, students spend just two hours a day using personalized learning programs from companies like IXL and Khan Academy. “As students work through lessons on subjects like math, reading, and science, the AI system will analyze their responses, time spent on tasks, and even emotional cues to optimize the difficulty and presentation of content,” according to Unbound’s charter school Spending less time on traditional curriculum frees up the rest of students’ days for life-skill workshops that cover “financial literacy, public speaking, goal setting, entrepreneurship, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving,” according to the Arizona application.Teachers are replaced by “guides” who lead those workshops.The student handbook for the Alpha School, the charter school Unbound’s founders operate in Texas, claims that its students “learn twice as much as standard school students while only spending 2 hours per day on academics.”Thanks to financial support and lobbying by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, many public and private schools have integrated personalized learning software like IXL and Khan Academy into their teacher-led curriculum, although experts have In its Arizona application, Unbound says its bold claims about how much its students will learn are based on the experiment it’s running on students in Texas, inspired by Elon Musk.“The founders of Unbound Academic Institute began with opening a high-end private school, Alpha, for the same reason Elon Musk started with higher-end Teslas: to create a product that generates insights and funding for future research and development,” the company wrote in its application.【要約】
アリゾナ州で新設される「Unbound Academy」は、従来の教師を配置せず、AIが主導する2時間の学習モデルを採用する画期的な学校システムを導入する。主な特徴は：• 1日2時間のみの学習時間
• IXLやKhan Academyなどのパーソナライズド学習プログラムを使用
• AIが生徒の反応、課題への取り組み時間、感情的な手がかりを分析
• 教師の代わりに「ガイド」と呼ばれるスタッフが生活スキルのワークショップを担当
• 従来の学習時間以外は、金融リテラシー、パブリックスピーキング、起業家精神などの実践的スキルを学ぶこのプログラムはテキサス州での実験をモデルとしており、イーロン・マスクのテスラの事業展開方法を参考にしている。ただし、このような個別学習ソフトウェアの教育効果については専門家から疑問の声も上がっている。
