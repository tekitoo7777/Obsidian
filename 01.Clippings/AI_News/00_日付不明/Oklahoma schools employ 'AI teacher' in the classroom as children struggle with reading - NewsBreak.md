After facing threats of a state takeover amid years of low academic achievement results, Tulsa schools have turned to an AI teacher Amira has already been introduced to some Amira is a tool "designed to enhance reading skills through AI-driven assessments, real-time feedback, and personalized practice strategies," according to a website for the AI teacher. She says: "I support students by evaluating their reading abilities and providing tailored instruction to improve their fluency, comprehension, and overall literacy skills. My approach is based on the Science of Reading, ensuring that I effectively support educators and students in their learning journey."READ MORE: READ MORE: ![image_20250519_191415.png](../assets/image_20250519_191415.png)
Carnegie Elementary is one of the schools using the AI teacher, In comparison, 48 percent of students used the program last year and only 32 percent met the reading goals. Johnson, who has been tasked with improving reading scores within the district, has hailed it a success.State Superintendent Ryan Walters agrees, he said: “TPS is the example for the state in the way they've used Amira to ensure kids are learning on grade level." Amira is now available to all public school districts in Oklahoma but information about other districts who've adopted the program has not been released.![image_20250519_191416.png](../assets/image_20250519_191416.png)
Oklahoma is ranked 49th in education nationally, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, with 76% of fourth graders not proficient in reading. Superintendent Walters is hoping Amira can help to change this.“We had a national test score come out earlier in the week that showed our urban city schools dramatically improved they nearly increased 20 ranking points in the testing models, so we are seeing dramatic improvements in our big city schools. TPS, OKCPS, we're going to continue to push for reforms," he said.The use of AI in classrooms has become a controversial topic and comes as Pope Francis issued a warning about AI teachers in a Vatican document released last week.![image_20250519_191416.png](../assets/image_20250519_191416.png)
The document, which provides wide-ranging ethical guidelines in relation to the use of AI, states: "The physical presence of a teacher creates a relational dynamic that AI cannot replicate."The Vatican document acknowledges that AI can become “a valuable educational resource by enhancing access to education, offering tailored support and providing immediate feedback to students” but warns that “extensive use of AI in education could lead to the students’ increased reliance on technology, eroding their ability to perform some skills independently and worsening their dependence on screens.”
