Teaching is an uphill battle that grows harder and more exacting as the years roll by. Between budgetary constraints, bandwidth crunches, and a constantly changing syllabus, teachers have their hands full when it comes to structuring and building their class’s lessons and lectures. This predicament is only exacerbated by the recent breakthroughs in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and technology, which are accelerating scientific and mathematic discoveries, leading to rapid changes in every field’s accepted pedagogical and theoretical practices.To keep up with this breakneck pace of innovation in virtually every sphere, educators must employ the very tools that are enabling it, using AI to create classes that are not only up-to-date but are also engaging, intellectually stimulating, and accessible to their students.Here is one way teachers can use AI tools to curate an entire class’s flow, its study materials, and practice tests without the aid of an army of teaching assistants.Lesson planningThe efficiency and impact of any class taught over any length of time is entirely reliant upon the plan that powers it–the plan created before the first student ever steps into the classroom. For reasons detailed above, teachers might not have the resources to devote to this endeavor, which can prove to be harmful to all stakeholders. AI-powered lesson planners likeMagicSchool.ai, on the other hand, is a more expansive tool, and lesson planning is just one of the features it offers teachers. All it asks for is the topic, reading level, and any additional criteria teachers might have for their class, like an enhanced focus on accessibility or detailed deep dives into ethical implications.Educators can use these tools to quickly create engaging and topically-relevant lesson plans aligned with the latest innovations in their chosen fields. Unlike AI tools meant for the general public, I believe it’s imperative that any AI tool offer granular customization over the generated output. The aforementioned tools align with my stance, allowing teachers to fine-tune and modify the generated output using natural language prompts to achieve an end goal that works for them and for their students.Lesson creationOnce teachers or administrators are satisfied with their handiwork, they have an array of design and multimedia tools, both AI-powered and otherwise, to extract their imagination and plop them into the digital world. Today, most teachers opt for a flavor of blended learning: using both multimedia and text to create a more engaging educational experience. While AI promises and delivers unparalleled accuracy and creativity in text, its impact in the multimedia world is restricted, and teachers will need to flex their creative muscles to get these tools to work for them. Picking up where I left off in the previous section,I’d also like to extend a noteworthy mention toTo enhance engagement and make learning materials more appealing, educators can use easy-to-use design tools like Canva, Microsoft Designer, Adobe Firefly, and even OpenAI’s DALLE-3, to create visually rich and strikingly realistic images and slides.- Canva

Teachers and educators should aim to use a combination of these tools, opting to choose tools that offer greater usability and ease of creation to supplement their work.Testing and quizzingThe natural next step in a teacher’s odyssey involves creating quizzes, mid-semester exams as well as finals, and it’s a challenging pursuit because of the sheer volume of content that teachers must assimilate and absorb to be able to come up with thought-provoking and meaningful questions that truly test a student’s understanding and learning ability. Fortunately, AI has the capability to absorb vast bodies of text and come up with meaningful questions as long as it is steered correctly. Teachers can use AI-powered tools like- Educators who choose to use MagicSchool for their lesson plans can also use MagicSchool’s specialized offering for quiz creation to create multiple-choice assessments that can even be exported to Google Forms.
- For a more expansive offering, teachers can use ChatGPT to create more comprehensive assessments that delve into not just the lessons they’re teaching but the chosen field of academia itself. Teachers can provide ChatGPT with their lessons by
- Chatterbot AI is similar to ChatGPT and can be used to create assessments for mathematics, physics, and other analytical subjects. Its enhanced accuracy in math and vast knowledge base make it the ideal option for teachers teaching advanced-level courses in STEM subjects. It can even create plots, graphs, and other diagrams to supplement assessments and create truly analytical questions.
I’ve found that just like any other AI-powered use case, leveraging a combination of these tools coupled with well-performing prompts can spell the difference between run-of-the-mill questions and truly stimulating ones.A disclaimer for all educators: During my testing, ChatGPT, Claude, Le Chat, and other AI tools would routinely generate rudimentary questions in response to my prompts. When you do use any of these AI tools to create your assessments, be very specific with your prompts. Mention your target difficulty level and the kinds of questions you’d like to see in the result. Additionally, in all my experiments, I found that the AI tools’ output quality dramatically improved when creating a limited set of questions, like three questions at a time. When asked to create entire assessments, the models failed to develop a set of satisfying questions, resorting to low-quality, elementary questions instead. Refer toPersonalizing feedback at scaleIn my opinion, personalization at scale is the frontrunner in the diadem of benefits that the AI revolution has inspired. The ability to create and personalize feedback at an individual level was, to put it mildly, unrealistic; one that had way too many blocking variables, not the least of which was its failure to scale. Educators and teachers now, however, can use specialized AI chatbots to realize this dream, using attempted assessments and answer keys to grade, mark, and provide feedback. The resources educators can utilize for this leg of the experience are already listed in the previous section:If educators are looking to grade hand-written tests, they can use tools likeWe’ve just begun to scratch the surface of the applications and implications of using AI to create, tailor, and curate lectures and class materials. As AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic race ahead in their pursuit ofAs long as teachers and educators consistently intervene and insert themselves into every step of the process, monitor both the inputs and the outputs (## Sign up for our K-12 newsletter
