However, 2023 surveys – an eternity ago in the AI Spring – suggested that roughly one-third of university students were already using it occasionally, and another third were using it weekly, with the latter figure rising to over half of pupils at senior school.However, 2024 research by the Though not statistically valid, anecdotal evidence from UK academics suggests that ChatGPT-authored assignments, or elements within assignments, are apparent in roughly half of all submitted work.Other surveys suggest that usage is higher among students from privileged backgrounds, though AI is known to have great utility for less advantaged learners, especially those who need a job to pay their way through college. More on that later.Whatever the exact figures are, therefore, large numbers of students are using AI in their coursework – so many, in fact, that it is almost certainly now the norm. And it has become that in just two years.So, the questions are why, and how are they using it? To answer them, the most important thing is to hear from students themselves.Frank Longdon is Student Insight and Voice Manager at Lancaster University Students’ Union. Speaking at a Westminster Higher Education Forum policy conference on the use of AI last week, he explained that the subject should be regularly and openly discussed by everyone involved.While some undoubtedly try to pass off work as their own – a centuries’ old problem in education – it would be wrong to assume that students’ overall use of AI is wrong, lazy, or symptomatic of some negative trend in society.Longdon said:That might include subjects where there is a vast amount of reading, precedent, and/or rules to digest, such as the law. Spotting which students are struggling with thousands of pages of text could lead to alternative methods of assessment, he suggested.He added:We can file that under ‘No sh**, Sherlock’. But what are honest students using it for? Longdon said:## A failure in policymaking
Put simply, AI is filling the gaps in teaching provision as an assistive technology – one that strips out the “grunt work”, he explained, even if that can lead to a “learning loss” in some cases. Plus, if students miss a lecture, AI could be a more reliable aid than another student’s notes.That said, Longdon acknowledged that there is, sometimes, a less positive reason for students’ enthusiastic uptake of AI:This is a troubling admission. But it should be obvious.For those of us who benefited from a free university education – not to mention lower property prices after graduating, plus cheaper travel, energy, and food – the knowledge that generations of students now leave university with five-figure debts speaks of a failure in policymaking.For many, that struggle has continued into middle age, with some millennials unable to get onto the property ladder, despite paying four-figure sums a month for rented rooms. In many cases, the sad truth is we have made life worse for our kids than it was for us.This is why many students are now forced to hold down jobs while studying, including casual work, night work, or deliveries, to pay their way through college and minimize the debt they carry later in life. So, who can blame them for turning to AI to help them use their available time?And these are problems that affect people from poorer backgrounds even more than those with wealthy parents.Longdon continued:He added:So, how should this affect university policymaking? He said:## My take
A valuable insight into the reality of student life today – and food for thought for older generations who have left their children with more problems than they faced themselves.## 要約
