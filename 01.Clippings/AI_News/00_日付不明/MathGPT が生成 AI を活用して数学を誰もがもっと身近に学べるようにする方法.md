MathGPT is hailed as a "even better, more accessible" way to teach mathematics.One of the headliner features of iPadOS 18, which powers the new iPad mini Although Apple touts Math Notes as an interplay of hardware, software, and intelligence, the reality is the functionality also involves accessibility as well. Much to the chagrin of every old school mathematics teacher who said we’d never have a calculator with us at all times nor could computers do math for us, Math Notes stands as concrete repudiation of those notions. From an accessibility viewpoint, Math Notes is a veritable godsend for anyone—students or otherwise—who has disabilities that make doing math problems difficult. From cognition to literally writing out numbers and symbols, Math Notes transcends sheer convenience. It can be a more accessible way to do math in ways truly only Apple could do because they famously aspire to tightly control the whole stack.MathGPTPeter Relan is chairman of edtech company “I witnessed how quality math instruction could build confidence, expand career options, and fundamentally change the trajectory of a person’s life,” Relan said of why math resonates with him. “This realization became the driving force behind my passion for MathGPT. While we can’t clone human tutors, we can harness the power of AI to provide even better, more accessible math help poised to help millions.”MORE FOR YOU### ‘$500 Billion In Three Weeks’—Tesla Billionaire Elon Musk Issues ‘Crazy’ Fed ‘Bankruptcy’ Warning After Sparking Bitcoin Price Panic

Relan characterized MathGPT as more than utilitarian; the overarching mission is to “democratize high-quality math education.” He went on to say that by combining cutting-edge generative AI technology with so-called “carefully curated curriculum alignment,” the end result is MathGPT is, according to Relan, “a cheat-proof, infinitely patient tutor that can support students and turbocharge instructors’ capacities.” For students, Relan said MathGPT offers 24/7 personalized support and more. For instructors, it serves as a “time-saving course manager.”CEO: C-suite news, analysis, and advice for top decision makers right to your inbox.By signing up, you agree to receive this newsletter, other updates about Forbes and its affiliates’ offerings, our As its name implies, MathGPT operates similarly to how, say, ChatGPT does: the user inputs a query or other information, then the system responds in kind based on said data. As the MaTHGPT website notes, the software “coaches students through any concept or problem by prompting, guiding, and encouraging students on their learning journey.” MathGPT doesn’t simply give up answers; rather, it “asks students thought-provoking questions alongside the material, deepening their understanding of key concepts” in an eminently scalable manner so as to reach every student with “limitless personalized tutoring.”MathGPT, currently in beta in more than 30 community colleges nationwide, exists because, as Relan told me, it “helps students get the college-level math support they need—without giving answers away while automating labor-intensive teacher tasks like course planning, assignment creation, and grading.” MathGPT’s march towards general availability comes at an opportune time, as the passage of Speaking of feedback, Relan said the reaction to the betas have been positive. At institutions such as De Anza, Fresno City College, and Pasadena City College in California, Relan said MathGPT has surpassed 50,000 sessions with students, with students averaging an additional 12.8 hours of support. Some mathematics instructors, he added, have excitedly noted “they’ve seen a major improvement in students’ grades.”"The assignments I give on MathGPT are averaging a As to the future for MathGPT, Relan has big dreams.“My hope is MathGPT can be that transformative force for countless students, opening doors and building the confidence needed to pursue STEM careers,” he said. “I’m excited for the potential that MathGPT has to create a more equitable future where every student has access to the kind of life-changing math instruction that shaped my own path.”この記事は、MathGPTという数学学習支援AIツールについて説明しています。主なポイントは以下の通りです：- MathGPTは、生成AIを活用して数学教育をより身近で効果的なものにすることを目指しています。
