The Brief- Arizona's Board of Charter Schools has approved an AI charter school for the state.
- School officials say learning for core academics is "just 2 to 2.5 hours a day."
- AI in education is not without controversy, however.
PHOENIXWhat To KnowAt a December 2024 meeting for the Arizona State Board for Charter Schools, members approved Unbound Academy, an online charter school that teaches with AI.Advertisement"Our teachers still do a lot of the teaching role, but they don’t do the actual teaching of academic concepts because we know that that’s something that AI can do really well," said Ivy Xu with the school.Xu said they have tested the teaching method on hundreds of students in Texas, and the school day is short because AI is so effective at tailoring teaching to each student."Because everything is personalized to the student, learning for core academics is just 2 to 2.5 hours a day," said Xu.After the two-hour school day, kids will be immersed in life skills program that is all about what the kid wants to learn.Advertisement"Gave the kids an opportunity to learn things that typically, people don’t get a chance to try and learn until they’re working, once they’ve graduated," said Kristin Mann.Class sizes, according to Xu, will be equivalent to public schools. For now, the school is only for 4th to 8th grade. Enrollment is capped at a couple of hundred kids for the next school year.## AI teaching not without controversy
AI teaching has been a rather controversial matter.The other sideOfficials with the country's largest teachers union have said that AI can enhance education. However, they are concerned with where the tech stands currently, adding that humans "must always be the center of the teaching and learning experience, and play a significant role."AdvertisementWe asked Xu if there will be teachers involved in this type of learning.What Xu Said"There will be teachers, and we’re hiring for Arizona certified teachers, as well as equivalently certified teachers around," said Xu.Members of the Board for Charter Schools also asked officials with the new charter school about student data privacy."How do you keep that safe?" a board member asked. "What's your safety component for each student?""We obviously make sure we meet all Federal mandates, in terms of FERPA and privacy," a school official replied.What's nextOfficials with the school have lso launched a separate AI school that will be dual-language.Advertisement## 要約
アリゾナ州の教育委員会が、AIを活用したチャータースクール「Unbound Academy」の設立を承認しました。主なポイントは以下の通りです：- AIを活用した教育により、基礎学習は1日2-2.5時間程度で完了
- 4年生から8年生を対象とし、来年度の生徒数は数百人に制限
- アリゾナ州認定教員も配置され、人間の教師も関与
- 基礎学習後は生徒の興味に応じた生活スキルプログラムを提供
ただし、全米最大の教員組合は、AIは教育を向上させる可能性があるものの、「教育の中心は常に人間でなければならない」と懸念を表明しています。また、生徒のデータプライバシーについても、連邦政府の規制に準拠する形で保護するとしています。
