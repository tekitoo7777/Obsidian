New AI-powered software uncovers hidden math challenges in students, offering teachers a groundbreaking tool for personalized education.

Researchers have long studied how early A new tool using ### The Science Behind Structure Sense
The idea of structure sense dates back to 1999, when researchers first described it as recognizing patterns within a math problem. Later studies linked early structure sense to arithmetic competence. A first grader with a strong grasp of number relationships is more likely to excel by second grade.Lotta practices math on the computer at the Wulfen Comprehensive School, with the help of AI and eye tracking.

Traditional assessments rely on verbal explanations or written responses, but these methods miss unspoken problem-solving strategies. That’s where eye-tracking technology comes in.Eye tracking follows a person’s gaze to see where and how long they focus on specific parts of a problem. When solving math tasks, children’s "Tracking eye movements in a single system using a webcam, recognizing learning strategies via patterns, and offering individual support is completely new," says Maike Schindler, a professor of mathematics education.Related Stories- Generative AI accelerates child language learning, study finds

### Eye-Tracking in Early Math Learning
Recent research shows that even five-year-olds recognize numerical patterns using visual cues. In one study, children who quickly identified groups of dots solved problems faster than those counting each dot individually.Another study found that ten-year-olds who focused on entire groups rather than individual numbers performed better in arithmetic. These findings, published in However, researchers wanted to explore structure sense in broader contexts. Instead of just testing how children count objects, they examined how they compare numbers and extend patterns. These tasks reflect how math skills evolve beyond basic enumeration.Student Niko from the Wulfen Comprehensive School learns math with the help of eye tracking and AI.

"Based on this, the software selects learning videos and exercises tailored to the student's needs."### AI-Powered Math Tutoring
The AI-based learning tool is designed to work with just a standard Researchers programmed the AI to detect different problem-solving strategies. For instance, when students count dots in a ten-frame grid, some quickly recognize missing numbers and skip ahead. Others methodically count each row, indicating a need for additional support. The AI sorts students into different "Individually customized lessons for high-achieving children are also possible in the future," says Lilienthal. The system creates automated reports for teachers, helping them provide personalized support. Instead of relying on test scores alone, educators can now see exactly where students struggle in real time.### A New Era in Math Education
The Wulfen Comprehensive School in Germany is the first institution to use this Students worked on quantity comparison tasks and repeating pattern extension tasks, as shown above. (CREDIT: Springer Nature)"We are delighted that we can now support significantly more children in their basic math skills," says one school official. "This means we can help more learners improve their math performance than in the past due to a lack of teachers."With teacher shortages and increasing class sizes, AI-driven tools offer a scalable solution. The system provides instant feedback, reducing the time needed for traditional assessments. More importantly, it ensures that struggling students receive help before falling behind.The researchers believe this technology could be expanded beyond elementary math.
