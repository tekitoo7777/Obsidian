AI technologies are permeating every aspect of human lives. While ranging from virtual assistants to self-driving cars, AI is completely transforming how people work, communicate, and learn. Likewise, learning the concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more and more crucial for students. Their ability to successfully navigate the future technological environment will be driven by their AI literacy.Teaching AI literacy should, however, begin in primary school when kids attain the age of ten. Since young minds are usually most receptive to new ideas, it will undoubtedly be of significance to introduce AI effectively as the technology becomes more pervasive in everyday life.## Role Of Educators
With the advent of ChatGPT and other models, artificial intelligence has taken centre stage for the majority of students in school today. Young kids may not be able to adequately assess the potency of these tools without the right guidance, which might have a variety of detrimental effects. This is where the role of educators comes into play.A significant role in the development of AI literacy is exercised by both parents and teachers. Nevertheless, they must be knowledgeable about AI themselves in order to carry out this role effectively. They require instruction on the pedagogical, ethical, and sociological facets of AI along with its technical elements.Also, educators play an important role in developing an AI-positive learning environment. This entails creating a classroom setting that values research, critical thinking, and ethical reflection about artificial intelligence.It involves using diverse approaches to improve learning while critically assessing the use of AI.Some of them are listed below:Starting With BasicsAfter that, educators may also provide real-life examples of AI-enabled virtual assistants, most of which they use regularly without even realising they are utilising AI. Giving students a glimpse of how AI is used and influences their daily lives inspires their curiosity and builds a strong platform for future learning.Online Resources:Several online tools are available for educators to teach AI literacy to their children, including the Free Basic Courses in AI and ML offered by Nvidia, Google, and Microsoft.Coding Games:The use of these games can help students develop problem-solving abilities and creativity as they try to overcome problems in the game using code. Using such an instructive yet interesting approach is certain to attract young minds and kindle their curiosity about solving AI's secrets.Educators can visit websites such as CodaKid, Scratch, and Blockly, which provide a variety of engaging games for young children to learn about coding fundamentals.Comics:The visual format and narrative storylines are better understood and retained with interactive elements encouraging active participation and critical thinking. One of such Comic Book Series available is"WHY AI".Hands-On Activities: It will be more helpful for students to apply Python coding and generative AI in real-world applications. Similarly, learners should be encouraged to perform industry-related projects with AI to complete their learning with practical outcomes.This type of active learning requires direct engagement with AI systems.## What Parents Can Do On AI Privacy
Today, AI systems are continually evaluating children's activities to make predictions and decisions that benefit not just them but also the AI's creators. It's therefore important for educators to teach students the significance of privacy and prudence while dealing with artificial intelligence-driven services available on the internet.They can try to describe how their online behaviour affects the AI's response and the information it provides to them, right down to the slightest nuances. For example, certain websites that offer goods or services could alter their rates based on how long a user stays on a page.A more sinister example is that oversharing personal information on social media may allow AI algorithms to target users with improper content or expose them to real-world threats.The incorporation of AI into education can transform traditional teaching techniques, give vital insights for student improvement and provide learners with the skills they need to survive in a technologically driven environment.Furthermore, AI tools are a strong and interesting technology that may assist children with their academic work across a variety of areas. As a parent or teacher, one can confidently teach children and incorporate AI tools to help them with their schoolwork while communicating and encouraging them to use technology wisely and responsibly.By embracing this initiative, educators can harness the full potential of AI in education and prepare students for success in the ever-changing digital world.(The author is the Director of YuviPep)Disclaimer:Education Loan Information:Calculate Education Loan EMIPublished at : 04 Jul 2024 01:57 PM (IST)Tags :AIFollow 
人工知能（AI）はビジネス、経済、社会の根本的な構造を変えており、学生がAIの概念を学ぶことがますます重要になっています。AIリテラシーは小学校の段階から始めるべきであり、教育者と親がその役割を果たすためにAIについての知識を持つことが求められています。教育者はAIの基礎を教え、オンラインリソースやコーディングゲーム、コミック、実践活動を通じて学生の興味を引き出し、AIに対する理解を深めることが重要です。また、親はAIのプライバシーとインターネット上での注意点について子供に教える役割を果たします。AIの教育への統合は、伝統的な教育方法を変革し、学生の向上に役立ち、技術的に駆動される環境での成功に必要なスキルを提供します。
