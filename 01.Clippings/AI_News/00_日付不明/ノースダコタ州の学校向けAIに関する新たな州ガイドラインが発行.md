FARGO, N.D. (Valley News Live) - North Dakota School Superintendent Kirsten Baesler says new state guidance about artificial intelligence has been designed to help local schools develop their own AI policies, and help teachers and administrators work more efficiently.The information, which has been Baesler said implementing AI, or any other instructional tool, requires planning and alignment with existing educational priorities, goals, and values.“Humans should always control how AI is used, and review any AI output for errors,” Baesler said. “We must emphasize keeping the main thing the main thing, and that is to prepare our young learners for their next challenges and goals.”Steve Snow and Kelsie Seiler, who work in the NDDPI Office of School Approval and Opportunity, said guidance information was drawn from other state agency education agencies and technology websites, such as “We had a team that looked at guidance from other states, and we pulled pieces from different places, and actually built guidance tailored for North Dakota students,” Snow said.Seiler noted that AI is best at data analysis, predictive analytics – which examines past behavior to predict future actions – and automating repetitive tasks. It is not good at emotional intelligence, interdisciplinary research and problem solving, or inventive concepts.Snow added that one possible use of AI for teachers is to design lesson plans that align with North Dakota’s academic content standards. This can be done quickly, and plans can be changed to accommodate students who may not have initially grasped the material.“You have so many resources (teachers) can use that are going to make your life so much easier,” Snow said. “I want the teachers, administration and staff to get comfortable with using (AI), so they’re a little more comfortable when they talk to kids about it.”Seiler also pointed out that the NDDPI guidance is not a “how-to” manual for using AI, but provides general suggestions on how to develop local policies to take advantage of it in ways that make families, students and teachers comfortable.“Our guidance is meant to provide some tools to the school administration and say, ‘Here are some things to think about when you implement your own AI guidance,’” Snow said. “For instance, do you have the infrastructure to support (AI)? Do you have a professional development plan so your teachers can understand it? Do you have governance in place, that says what AI can and can’t be used for?”Copyright 2024 KVLY. All rights reserved.ノースダコタ州の学校向け新たなAIガイドラインが発行されました。州教育監督官のキルステン・ベースラー氏は、このガイドラインが各学校でのAIポリシーの策定や教師・管理者の効率向上に役立つと述べています。ガイドラインは、州の教育機関や技術機関の協力を得て約8ヶ月かけて作成されました。AIの利用には慎重な計画と既存の教育目標との整合が必要であり、人間が常にAIの使用方法を管理し、結果を検証することが強調されています。また、AIはデータ分析や予測分析、反復作業の自動化に優れていますが、感情知能や学際的な研究、創造的な問題解決には適していません。ガイドラインは具体的な「使い方」マニュアルではなく、各学校が独自のAIポリシーを策定する際の一般的な提案を提供するものです。
