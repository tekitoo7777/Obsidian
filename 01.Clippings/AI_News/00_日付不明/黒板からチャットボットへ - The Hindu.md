In the bustling classrooms of yesteryear, the sound of chalk against the blackboard was the heartbeat of learning. Now, imagine stepping into a classroom where AI tutors assist you in real time, providing personalised feedback as if they have known you forever. This is not a scene from a futuristic movie; it’s the emerging reality in education today.But a question arises: are we on the brink of an educational utopia with infinite possibilities, or are we losing the irreplaceable human touch in the process? Before concluding with any views, we need to understand how AI is transforming the educational landscape.Like most technologies, AI too is knife-edged, with benefits and drawbacks. AI is not just a tool for the future; it’s a powerful ally in today’s classrooms. We can use AI for management and delivery, assessment and evaluation, personalised learning styles, and global-level exposure to students.The biggest contribution that AI could make to education in the Indian context will be to promote the idea of learning as learner-centered, moving from the one-size-fits-all approach that is dominant and expanding the limited content and pedagogy practices of most teachers.To make it more learner-centered and more engaged with students, AI tools incorporate gamification and interactivity. Interactive AI applications and gamified quizzes make learning fun and immersive. These tools use AI to create dynamic and engaging learning experiences that capture students’ attention and motivate them to learn.However, having all these in mind, what if we turn the table otherwise? Think about the teachers who inspired you — was it their command of the curriculum or was it their energy, humour, and personal stories that ignited a love of learning?There are drawbacks at both the technical and human-element level. At the technical level, the main challenge is data privacy and security, especially when personal and sensitive data of students and teachers is collected. Recently, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023 has been passed, aiming to mitigate these issues. Likewise, the EU has adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applied to any AI-based educational solution. The U.S. has the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) to regulate information with respect to children under 13 online.At the human-element level, teachers provide empathy, encouragement, and that sense of belonging in the classroom, which no algorithm can replicate. While AI can offer personalised learning paths based on data, it lacks the ability to notice the glint of understanding in a student’s eyes or the slumped posture of frustration that tells you it’s time to switch tactics.Although AI has made significant strides in analysing extensive datasets and recognising intricate patterns, it still struggles to replicate the nuanced understanding of human emotions. Emotion detection in AI often involves analysing facial expressions, speech patterns, and physiological cues. However, incorporating cultural diversity and biases into training datasets can hinder accuracy and efficiency.In whatever way we turn the table, AI remains a double-edged sword. It has the potential to enhance learning experiences in unprecedented ways. Yet, we must remain mindful of preserving the human elements that make education truly impactful. The journey from chalkboards to chatbots is an exciting one, promising a future where technology and humanity work hand in hand to create a more inclusive and effective educational system. Innovation and empathy must coexist, crafting an education system that is not just smart but also deeply human.snigdhasethi842@gmail.comPublished - January 19, 2025 03:00 am IST
