The initiative, according to the ministry, aims to pool quality resources and enhance their accessibility.Authorities will encourage colleges, universities, research institutes and high-tech companies to open their AI labs and exhibition halls to primary and secondary school students.Minister of Education Huai Jinpeng has likened AI to a "gold key" for the education system, emphasizing its potential to shape the future of education while presenting both opportunities and challenges.In February, the country selected 184 schools as pilot bases to explore philosophies, models and programs in AI education, with the goal of developing exemplary cases and experience that can be promoted on a larger scale.More such educational bases will be established in the future, per the ministry circular.Source(s): Xinhua News Agency
