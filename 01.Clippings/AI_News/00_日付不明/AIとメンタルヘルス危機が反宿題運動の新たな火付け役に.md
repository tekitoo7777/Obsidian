Illustration: Aïda Amer/AxiosDogs may not have anything to eat, but students could feel less stress if Why it matters: - 37% of 13-year-old students said they had "no homework assigned" on the day before a National Center for Education Statistics 
- In 2020, that figure was 29%. In 2012, it was 21%.
Case in point: - "It helps increase the overall social-emotional health of our students because they're not so focused, especially at the elementary level, just on 'academic, academic, academic,'" Jay Eads, the school's principal, told Axios.
- "They're able to explore other aspects of their life, which they should be doing at this developmental stage."
Zoom out: - 67% of high school students cited homework load as a major source of stress in a 
- The percentage increased to 80% among those doing three or more hours of homework daily.
The big picture: - With younger students, there's less research showing homework improves academics, Pope said. But reading for pleasure has been linked to higher achievement in those early grades.
- For older students, decreasing homework loads also helps level the field for employed students or those managing familial responsibilities, Pope said.
The intrigue: - 19% of teens said they've used ChatGPT to help with their school work, according to a 
- 69% said it's acceptable to use to research new topics; 39% said it's acceptable to use AI to solve math problems; and 20% said it's acceptable to use to write essays.
- "You want to be able to have kids at least allegedly want to do the work and therefore not turn to AI" for cheating, Pope said. That's especially important given discussions over the value of learning and how AI could help or impede it, she added.
Zoom in: - As president of Curiosity 2 Create, which provides educators with professional development, she's witnessed teachers become increasingly intentional about assignments.
- This could mean assigning five math problems instead of 20 — or asking questions to foster creative and critical thinking rather than a simple answer.
- "Am I giving homework so that I am keeping my administrators happy because I have to give homework?" Trowbridge posed as a hypothetical question. "Or am I giving homework because it is a meaningful exercise that kids need to do in order to establish learning and extend learning?"
What we're watching: - Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo proposed the bill after her daughter asked her if she could "ban homework" when elected. Schiavo realized the fourth grader's request had some merit.
- "As a single mom, I only have a couple of hours with my kid at night before they have to go to bed," said Schiavo, whose daughter is now in seventh grade. "Spending most of that struggling to get homework done creates a lot of stress on a family."

Editor's note: The story has been updated to reflect the bill has passed and is awaiting Gov. Gavin Newsom's signature. It has also been updated with additional quotes from Stanford education researcher Denise Pope.![image_20250519_192023.png](../assets/image_20250519_192023.png)

この記事は、宿題に関する最近の議論についてまとめています。主なポイントは以下の通りです：- 生徒のメンタルヘルスの問題とAIの台頭により、宿題の価値に関する議論が活発化しています。
- 多くの学校で宿題を出さない方針が採用されつつあり、2023年の調査では37%の13歳生徒が「前日に宿題が出されなかった」と回答しています。
- 宿題と学業成績の相関関係は測定が難しく、特に低学年では宿題よりも読書の方が効果的という研究結果もあります。
- AIチャットボットの登場により、宿題の意義や学習方法についての議論が更に複雑化しています。
- カリフォルニア州では、宿題がメンタルヘルスに与える影響を評価する法案が可決され、知事の署名を待っている状況です。
この議論は、生徒の全人的な発達と学習効果のバランスを取ることの重要性を示唆しています。
