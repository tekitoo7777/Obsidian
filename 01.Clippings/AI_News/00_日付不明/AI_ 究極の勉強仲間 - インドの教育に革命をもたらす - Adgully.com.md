Picture this: A classroom where each lesson feels tailor-made for every student, where teachers are empowered by intelligent tools to elevate their craft, and where learning transcends the confines of traditional methods. This isn’t a distant future – it’s the promise of Artificial Intelligence in education. As AI begins to weave its way into the fabric of teaching, it is set to transform how knowledge is delivered and absorbed, revolutionizing the role of educators and redefining the student experience.In this series, Adgully dives into the AI-driven evolution of education, exploring how this technology will not just enhance, but fundamentally reimagine, the way we teach and learn. From personalized learning pathways to interactive, data-driven classrooms, discover how AI is poised to unlock new potentials and challenges in the world of education.In this series, Adgully brings together compelling insights from leading educators, faculty members, and ed-tech innovators, offering a comprehensive look at the future of education.Shrinidhi RS, Founder and CEO, Cherrilearn“In terms of impact on teaching methods, imagine a classroom where AI tutors analyse student performance data and create customized learning plans. This is no longer science fiction in today’s world; adaptive learning platforms powered by AI adjust the difficulty, pace, and format of learning materials (text, video, games) to suit each student's strengths and weaknesses. A 2023 study by Pearson AI can tailor tough content appealing to students.“A struggling math student might benefit from interactive games that make practising skills fun, while an advanced science student could delve deeper into complex topics with AI-curated resources. This variety caters to different learning styles and keeps students motivated. AI tutors and chatbots provide 24/7 support, offering constant access to learning resources and allowing students to get help with homework concepts or clarify doubts outside of class hours, thus extending learning beyond the classroom walls. Additionally, AI-powered simulations and virtual reality create realistic learning environments for practising skills in various fields, from science experiments to public speaking, enabling students to gain practical experience without real-world risks, such as practising surgery in a safe, virtual environment before operating on a real patient,” explains Shrinidhi.Traditional education, often characterized by a "one-size-fits-all" approach, is undergoing a significant transformation thanks to AI, opines “As a global deeptech company powered by AI, this is where we are seeing a completely different approach we can take to learning, with AI. The rigid structure of traditional classrooms is giving way to a dynamic, student-centric environment fueled by AI. Imagine a system that analyzes a student’s strengths, weaknesses, and learning style. This data can then be used to create personalized learning plans, where students receive targeted practice for areas they struggle with, while those who grasp concepts quickly can move on to advanced materials. This ensures focused and efficient learning, eliminating the need to slog through irrelevant information. The power of AI lies not in replacing teachers, but in augmenting their capabilities. AI tools can handle repetitive tasks like grading and basic instruction, freeing up valuable teacher time. This allows educators to focus on what they do best: providing individualized attention, fostering critical thinking, and nurturing a love of learning,” he adds.AI is helping professors in curating new courses, helping them with content, presentations, says “AI is significantly enhancing faculty capabilities by assisting in the creation of multiple-choice quizzes (using platforms like Quizlet and ScribeSense), generating question papers, and curating cases, role plays, and immersive learning experiences (such as those offered by zSpace and Google Expeditions). These tools help make classes more engaging for students. AI-based platforms can also evaluate case discussions, group discussions, and assignments using well-defined rubrics. This means that classrooms, faculty, and their teaching methods will have digital twins, with AI tools supporting student responses and engagement. While it's easy to imagine these scenarios, the actual implementation will depend on how innovatively faculty members use AI tools in various teaching activities. By integrating AI services, faculty will enhance student learning through increased engagement in both teaching and evaluation processes,” says Bharadwaj.Ravi Bhushan, Founder and CEO, BrightCHAMPS“With AI, it is now possible to create high-quality content affordably and at scale, deliver it in multiple languages, and tailor it to a child’s specific interests and learning needs. For instance, if Child A enjoys history while Child B prefers science, AI can integrate coding projects and exercises on the same topic but use history as the storyline for Child A and science for Child B. Additionally, if Child A learns best through video and Child B through simulation, AI can cater to these preferences as well. Sophisticated AI learning platforms like BrightEDGE continuously learn from the latest student data, customizing the learning experience accordingly. This technology will impact teaching by reducing reliance on human resources – a key factor in affordability – allowing teachers to focus on their core skill of teaching. AI will handle the heavy lifting of analyzing and assessing students objectively, providing teachers with insights on each student’s current learning stage and needs,” Bhushan says.AI’s transformative impact on education lies in its ability to personalize learning experiences, enhance teaching methods, automate administrative tasks, and support continuous improvement in educational practices, says Personalized Learning and Support for specialized education:Adaptive Learning Systems:Interactive Learning Tools:Enhanced Teaching Methods:AI has the power to transform education by personalising learning experiences and improving teaching methods, says “In the Odisha Smart Classrooms project that we worked on in partnership with the Government of Odisha, AI is integrated into traditional teaching. It creates a more interactive and personalised learning environment. By analysing data, AI can understand how each student learns best, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. This allows teachers to tailor their teaching methods and content delivery to better suit each student's needs, which enhances engagement and boosts learning outcomes. AI-powered tools also provide instant feedback to both students and teachers, helping to adjust teaching strategies real-time. Virtual tutors and adaptive learning platforms further support classroom instruction by offering tailored assistance based on each student’s learning pace and comprehension level,” she adds.AI can greatly impact the entire spectrum of education right from engaging learners to enabling educators with content & curriculum to streamlining administrative tasks for institutions, points out The history of AI spans several decades, evolving through various phases marked by significant technological advancements, says “AI has transformed the traditional education system by providing more dynamic, interactive, and accessible services. AI has allowed educators to address individual students' needs by providing personalized learning platforms and intelligent tutoring systems. AI has also helped to improve the overall outcome by providing automated grading and administrative services. With the help of predictive analytics, AI can analyze the student performance data and identify the areas of improvement, enabling early intervention by the instructor,” he adds.AR/VR technologies are already changing the way students learn, says - Creating dynamic content which can adapt to individual student needs and difficulty levels
- Creating automated assessments and grading based on student profile
- Real-time feedback to students and dynamic changes in course content accordingly
- Perform analytics and provide feedback to teachers on difficult areas in the curriculum so that they can develop better methods for teaching those topics.
(To be continued…)Mediaこの文章は、AIが教育分野にもたらす革命的な変化について説明しています。主なポイントは以下の通りです：- 個別化された学習：AIは各学生のニーズに合わせた学習体験を提供します。
- リアルタイムフィードバック：学生は即座に学習の進捗を確認できるようになります。
- 教師の役割の変化：教師は情報提供者からガイドやメンターへと役割が変わります。
- 教育へのアクセス拡大：AIは遠隔地や資源の乏しい地域でも質の高い教育を提供する助けとなります。
- 学生の参加度向上：インタラクティブな学習体験により、学生の参加度が高まると期待されています。
また、AIを活用することで、教師は授業計画の作成や評価プロセスを効率化できる可能性があります。ただし、AIの使用には倫理的な配慮が必要であり、教育者が常にプロセスに関与し、監視することが重要です。
