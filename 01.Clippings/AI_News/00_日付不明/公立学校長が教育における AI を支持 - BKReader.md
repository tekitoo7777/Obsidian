Banks on Tuesday called on schools to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) while citing its benefits, including assessing students' learning capabilities, optimizing teaching and learning experience, and providing career guidance.Delivering the annual “State of Our Schools” speech at the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, Queens, Banks said schools needed to move away from "outdated methods of evaluation" and embrace new technology to future-proof students."For too long, we’ve relied on outdated methods of evaluation. With AI, we can analyze all of the work students produce—homework, classwork, tests—in real-time, giving teachers a daily, accurate picture of each child’s progress," Banks said.He cited Eureka, an AI-powered chatbot that assists staff with administrative duties, as an example of AI’s potential in schools. Banks also noted plans to expand AI into areas like transportation, enrollment and hiring for a more efficient and holistic school system.“Doing so will save us time and money, freeing up resources for our schools and improving the overall experience for students, families and staff,” he explained.Beyond the classroom, students would acquire skills ensuring employment post-high school, Banks added."AI is already shaping our workforce and our world, and we have an obligation to equip our children with new skillsets in response."Banks also stated that AI could not replace teachers."AI cannot replace the power of a great teacher, counselor or principal. But AI can elevate their work, greatly improving student outcomes in the process," he said.During his annual address, the chancellor also talked about the expansion of the school system's new reading curriculum 要約：- ニューヨーク市公立学校のDavid C.
